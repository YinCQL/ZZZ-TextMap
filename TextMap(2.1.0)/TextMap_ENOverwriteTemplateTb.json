  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_01": "Morning, Wise! You're just in time. This lady actually picked classical music for the festival's opening piece! Come on, help me talk her out of it!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_02": "Classical music can liven up the atmosphere just as well, and since I've studied it since childhood, I can make the arrangements even better! This is our music festival, after all. It deserves a design that's fresh and original.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_03": "...You weren't that good at negotiating when we first met. How'd you get so skilled? Fine, let me think about it a bit more. For now, let's get back to checking the performer list!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_04": "You're pretty energetic for this early hour!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_05": "How's the music festival prep going?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_06": "Feeling totally recharged after a full night's sleep~! Manato's covering the other attractions today, so Alice and I are diving headfirst into music fest prep!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_08": "But there are still those willing to come. As of this morning, we've got all the dozen or so bands and singers confirmed for the performance... In the name of Thymefield, we will make this music festival a success!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_09": "Of course! But if we really want the festival to be a hit, I still don't think we should open with classical music. Mixing in a few classical elements into pop, though? That I'm totally on board with! Anyway, we've still got a lot to prep today...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_10": "Sounds like fun.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_12": "Knew you'd say that~ But it might be more tiring than you think! If it gets too much, you can always go chill on the beach chairs and soak up some sun~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_13": "When I'm tired",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_14": "I just slack off a little!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_15": "Having agreed with Alice and Yuzuha to take a more relaxed approach to the prep work, you spend some time setting up props in front of the stage, then wander down to the beach to splash in the water... Before you know it, night quietly falls.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_16": "I can't believe it's this late already... Were we perhaps a little too inefficient today?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_17": "Haven't we got most of the prep done already? Alice, you're stressing way too much! Why don't we grab Belle and Manato and head over to the Sailboat Drinks Stand? We can catch the evening breeze and watch some spooky movies!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_18": "Watching movies with friends at night... I've never tried that before! Let's go!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_19": "Aaaaahhhhhh!!!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_20": "G-Ghost! There's a ghost!!!!!!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_22": "Looks like there's an emergency.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_23": "What... Did someone just say... ghost?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_24": "...Yeah, looks like it. Guess our movie night's gonna have to wait a bit.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_26": "Huh? U—Uhh... we're... we're going there? For real...?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_28": "Haven't we got most of the prep done already? Alice, you're stressing way too much! Why don't we grab Wise and Manato and head over to the Sailboat Drinks Stand? We can catch the evening breeze and watch some spooky movies!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013502_29": "Morning, Belle! You're just in time. This lady actually picked classical music for the festival's opening piece! Come on, help me talk her out of it!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013511_08": "You can see tears welling up in Therese's eyes.\nWhile observing the reception area, someone suddenly taps your shoulder. You turn to find {M#Belle}{F#Wise}, Yuzuha, and Alice standing behind you. You all move to a more convenient spot to talk...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013511_09": "You can see tears welling up in Therese's eyes.\nWhile observing the reception area, someone suddenly taps your shoulder. You turn to find Wise, Yuzuha, and Alice standing behind you. You move to a more convenient spot to talk...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_03": "Mr. Wise came to see us for a reason, I'm sure. Is there anything we can help you with?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_04": "I'd like to know more about the resort...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_05": "To get closer to the truth behind the haunting.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_06": "I see... No need to be so formal, we'll answer as best we can.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_07": "About your debt situation with Willis...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_08": "Willis... that guy suddenly showed up after the resort had been operating for just over a year.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_09": "Due to rumors of hauntings when we first opened, our business took a nosedive, and we couldn't even recover our initial investment. That's when he came to us, saying he couldn't bear to see this place go under and wanted to help.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_10": "Back then, Willis was already a division manager at Three Gates Corp., riding high on his own success... Years have passed, and he's still stuck in that manager position with no promotions. Haha, I guess that's karma catching up with him for all his dirty deeds!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_11": "Long story short, we were desperate back then and thought we'd found a lifeline. Miss signed a contract with him, and according to the agreement, Three Gates Corp. gave us a huge sum of money, with a strict deadline for repayment.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_12": "That money only prolonged the resort's struggles, and after several years, we still haven't generated any real profits. Now, with the deadline approaching... we're running out of time.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_13": "What happens if you can't pay up?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_14": "According to the terms of the agreement... <color=#FFAF2C>the resort will be transferred to Three Gates Corp.</color> I suspect this was their scheme all along to take the resort.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_15": "*sigh* No use crying over past mistakes now... If only I could save up enough to pay off the debt and interest, I wouldn't have to lose sleep over that snake Willis anymore.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_16": "I'd like to know more...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_17": "En-nuh! Ennana! (Empy's got something to say! Empy spent all night patrolling with that tanuki called Kamanosuke... but we didn't spot anyone suspicious!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_18": "En-nuh-ne! (But Empy saw... <color=#FFAF2C>saw a mosquito landing on thin air</color>!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_19": "En-na... enne-enne-ehn-ne! (I'm not too sure either. I was really sleepy, so maybe I saw it wrong... I'm gonna bring a camera and take another stroll tonight, maybe I'll run into it again!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_20": "En-neh... nuh? Nah! (This... isn't a haunting, right? If it is, Empy won't tell a soul! Gotta protect the resort's reputation!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_21": "...Actually, Mr. Wise, there's something I haven't mentioned before. This resort was built 11 years ago, and back then, it was called <color=#FFAF2C>\"Midsummer Resort\"</color>... We've kept that from most people — until now.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_22": "Miss, about this—",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_23": "Ege, no need to keep hiding it anymore... Wise, Alice, and Yuzuha have done so much for us. We shouldn't keep staying silent about this.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_24": "Fantasy Resort was <color=#FFAF2C>one of Midsummer Inc.'s assets</color>... the same Midsummer Inc. that <color=#FFAF2C>once rivaled Three Gates Corp. in military tech before disappearing during the fall of the Old Capital</color>.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_25": "The CEO of Midsummer Inc. was my father, as well as Ege's boss and Empy's first Master... Eleven years ago, during the fall of the old capital, he was swallowed by the Hollow along with almost all of Midsummer Inc.'s assets.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_26": "Before all this, he planned to transform Midsummer Inc. from the military industry to entertainment... Midsummer Resort was meant to be the first step in this transformation. Unfortunately, his departure and the company's downfall turned everything into foam on the waves.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_27": "Due to the fall of the Old Capital, the resort's opening was postponed indefinitely. Therese's father showed me great kindness... So I stayed here with the other staff, tending to Midsummer Inc.'s remaining assets, to look after the young miss.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_28": "After six years, I felt I was finally capable of standing on my own two feet, so I decided to properly take care of my father's inheritance... this resort. So I opened this resort to visitors five years ago.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_29": "But if we kept calling it Midsummer Resort, its connection to Midsummer Inc. would be too obvious. To avoid unnecessary controversy, after careful consideration, we decided to rename it Fantasy Resort.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_30": "I'm sorry we didn't share all of this earlier. It wasn't intentional... We just didn't expect all of this to happen. I hope what we've shared can help you get closer to the truth behind the haunting...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_31": "Got a bunch of clues.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_32": "But the truth behind the haunting is still a bit hazy...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_33": "I understand... I'm sorry. If I come across any other clues, I'll be sure to let you know.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_34": "Ege, no need to keep hiding it anymore... Belle, Alice, and Yuzuha have done so much for us. We shouldn't keep staying silent about this.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_35": "...Actually, Miss Belle, there's something I haven't mentioned before. This resort was built 11 years ago, and back then, it was called <color=#FFAF2C>\"Midsummer Resort\"</color>... We've kept that from most people — until now.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_36": "Miss Belle came to see us for a reason, I'm sure. Is there anything we can help you with?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_37": "Miss Belle, you're here... Sorry, I've been dealing with tourist complaints all day, so I'm a bit low on energy... Please don't mind me...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013512_40": "Due to the fall of the Old Capital, the resort's opening was postponed indefinitely. Therese's father showed me great kindness... So I stayed here with the other remaining staff, tending to Midsummer Inc.'s remaining assets, to look after the young miss.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013513_07": "I'm a pro surfer with the Janus Quarter surf team. We were trying to get a sponsorship deal with Three Gates Corp., and everything was going great. We'd even met with one of their marketing suits...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013513_10": "He's got an over-inflated ego. He just thinks he's better than everyone else in the room, no matter whether it's us or his own colleagues. He always goes off on these monologues, going on and on about his glittering achievements...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013513_14": "I've got friends in other circles, so I asked around. Turns out he shut down several sponsorship deals back-to-back. Plus, his need for attention has left quite an impression on everyone who's met him... I know his promotion history pretty much off by heart now.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013513_17": "No worries! I've seen you all checking things out around here. Hope this info helps... And hey, if your brain gets all jammed up, come catch some waves with me! Nothing clears the mind like a good surf, trust me.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013513_18": "Let's go surfing for a break!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013514_02": "Don't worry. We're gonna find out what's really hiding behind all these ghost stories. So we'll need to hear a bit from you and the others about the resort and all~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013514_09": "Nope, they couldn't even produce a single photo to prove what they saw... But public opinion is just weird like that. At first, only a few people in the crowd supported the troublemakers, but eventually it evolved to where most tourists were backing them up.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013514_11": "For us residents living nearby who know the ins and outs, that incident was clearly someone pulling strings behind the scenes. But there's no evidence pointing to Willis... Therese and the others probably can't do anything about it either.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013514_14": "I'm not sure... but I bet there must be some profit in it, right? Though an 11-year-old small resort would seem pretty insignificant to Three Gates Corp...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013514_17": "Huh... Didn't anyone tell you? The Fantasy Resort was built 11 years ago. I was still little then, but I remember it clearly. There was this new resort near our home... It just didn't open until five years ago, for some reason.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013514_18": "And even the resort's name wasn't originally \"Fantasy\"... Eleven years ago, though there wasn't an official sign up yet, I heard from the workers around here that they were planning to call it \"Midsummer Resort.\"",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013515_01": "After wrapping up the chats with the resort staff, you join Alice and Yuzuha in a quieter spot to exchange what you've each found out...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013515_02": "...Oh... so there's more to it than I thought...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013516_07": "Together with Empy and Alice, you board the large boat and head out toward waters farther from the resort...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013519_03": "But don't worry — Manato made sure to evacuate all the nearby visitors right away, so this shouldn't have much of an impact on the resort's image... Hm? Alice, what's wrong?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013523_06": "With the \"Paranormal\" filter on, you can both pinpoint the projector's exact location on screen and disable its cloaking by taking a photo.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013523_13": "The three nod in silent agreement and head off to their respective haunted locations...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_01": "Hiding in a spot where few would think to look, you spot a group of sneaky thugs quietly slipping into the resort. They look uneasy, and you can hear every word they say...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_02": "Wh—What the heck? We did put it here... So why's it completely gone?!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_03": "You idiot! One simple job and you still blew it! Don't tell me you messed up the spot. Projectors don't just grow legs and leave!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_05": "Tch... damn, you're right... But how the hell did it go missing just like that? If he finds out, we're all screwed!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_06": "...Whatever. No time for this now. We'll figure it out later. We've still got a bunch of projectors to pick up. Let's get moving!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_07": "Mhm... just as I thought, they walked right into our hands. Sounds like they're the ones who brought the projector here too.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_09": "No surprise there. A sly old fox like him would never get his own hands dirty. Still, this is good enough — we caught them red-handed, and there's no talking their way out of it.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_13": "I need some time to prepare.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013528_14": "You show up, ready for battle, right in front of the thugs. Panic flashing across their faces, they clearly didn't expect to be found... but in no time, they've got their helmets on and weapons drawn. The fight is on!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013529_02": "Tch, you idiot, who else could it be...? We've been spotted! I told you to move faster!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013529_05": "So you wanna throw hands, huh...? Boys, helmets on! Keep your heads safe! Let's show 'em what we're made of!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013529_07": "I need some time to prepare.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_01": "Looks like this whole haunting business has finally settled down... Now we can properly focus on getting the music festival ready.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_02": "The big day's almost here, but we've still got a mountain of details to sort out~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_03": "But first things first, it's already pretty late... Let's get some rest and power through it tomorrow!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_04": "Looks like I can finally get a good night's sleep... Staying up late is a lady's worst enemy when it comes to beauty!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_05": "Wise, you'd better get some sleep too! No sleeping in tomorrow morning, okay~?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_06": "Mhm, you all get some rest too.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_07": "Good night, and enjoy the sound of the waves!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013530_08": "Belle, you'd better get some rest too! When we've got time, the three of us have to do another girls' night chat!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013531_01": "Good morning, Mr. Wise! Now that last night's incident is behind us, the resort can finally stop worrying about hauntings... and it's all thanks to you!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013531_02": "Up next is the main event Yuzuha and Alice have been planning — the music festival. But from what they told me earlier, the resort's current visitor numbers might not be quite enough to support something on that scale just yet.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013531_03": "So, if we want the festival to go ahead as planned... we'll probably need your help bringing in a few more guests, at least until we reach the target they set in advance.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013531_04": "We got this!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013531_05": "Thanks so much for your help! And if you ever need updates on the current visitor numbers, feel free to check in with me anytime.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013531_06": "Good morning, Miss Belle! Now that last night's incident is behind us, the resort can finally stop worrying about hauntings... and it's all thanks to you!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013532_01": "Stand right here and check with the camera. I have a feeling you're in for a little surprise~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013533_01": "I can faintly hear something... like a subtle mechanical noise. Perhaps it's just my imagination. Could you check with the camera, just in case?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013534_01": "Up close, the scent here matches the one from that projector perfectly. Let's see what shows up on the camera.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013534_Name_01": "Komano Manato",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013535_01": "Hehe, those guys aren't exactly hard to figure out~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013535_Name_01": "Ukinami Yuzuha",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013536_01": "Just as I thought... The \"ghost\" won't stay hidden for long!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013537_01": "Good... My nose didn't let me down.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013598_01": "Hmm...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013598_02": "What's wrong?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013599_02": "This is...?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_01": "Wise, look how many visitors we've got!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_02": "Wow, it's packed!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_03": "How'd it get so lively all of a sudden?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_04": "Mr. Arnold did thorough research on the resort's target audience, and although the advertising budget was tight, every Denny was well spent. That's why so many people came early just for tonight's music festival!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_05": "With this many people around, I'm feeling even more fired up! Come on, let's push through and finish checking off the rest of our to-dos!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_07": "Let me think... We've already booked the performers for the festival, and most of them have arrived at the resort. They're either getting ready backstage or relaxing somewhere nearby...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_08": "The stage is all fixed up and ready, and all staff are in position. First up is the sound check, then Manato will lead the guests to the waiting area, and we'll go through a rehearsal a bit later.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_09": "Feels like we're almost there!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_10": "Hehe, once the music festival's over, let's throw ourselves a little celebration! Gotta properly toast to the resort's full recovery!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_11": "Yuzuha, anything could still happen before the festival comes to a close. This isn't the time to let our guard down just yet!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_12": "Yeah, yeah~ And your little bunny ears and tail haven't stopped twitching since this morning either, right?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_13": "S—Stop staring at me all the time! Oh right, Wise, could I ask you for a favor? Actually, I'd like to hear what tourists around here think about the resort and the music festival...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_14": "When you're organizing an event, it's easy to overlook things from the audience's perspective. That's why I want to understand what the visitors here truly care about, so we can still make a few adjustments before the festival officially begins...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_17": "S—Stop staring at me all the time! Oh right, Belle, could I ask you for a favor? Actually, I'd like to hear what tourists around here think about the resort and the music festival...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013801_18": "Belle, look how many visitors we've got!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013802_01": "Hey bunny, seeing all these people, I bet you're thinking what I'm thinking, right?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013802_02": "Of course! The moment I saw this many people, I knew exactly what we'd both be thinking—",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013802_03": "—We're gonna rake in a fortune!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013802_04": "—The standing area must be symmetrical!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013803_01": "Morning, Wise. You're looking pretty energetic. Got a good night's rest, I take it?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013803_02": "I slept really well. How about you?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013803_03": "Not bad. I was patrolling around the resort until 3 a.m., just in case Willis and his gang tried anything again... But Empy came over and took my shift, so I got to head back and rest.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013803_04": "It's so nice to sleep in for once and wake up naturally, and the hotel breakfast was amazing... This place really is something special. If I could, I'd love to stay a few more days... at least until school starts.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013803_05": "Morning, Belle. You're looking pretty energetic. Got a good night's rest, I take it?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013804_01": "I can't wait anymore... I wish it'd get dark already!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013804_03": "Of course! I heard about the beach music festival on Inter-Knot, so I rushed over from Janus Quarter first thing in the morning! The ticket isn't too pricey. I'm totally hyped for this!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013804_04": "Is there anything you're concerned about?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013804_05": "Something I'm concerned about? You mean something that's not quite there yet? Hmm... probably the lineup? It's all mid-tier singers and bands. Feels like we're missing that real \"big name\" to hold it all together...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013804_06": "I'm mostly here to soak in the vibes, so it's not a big issue for me. But yeah, I bet some folks are hoping for more. If they suddenly dropped a surprise announcement about a superstar performing? This place would go wild!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013805_04": "...People were saying this resort used to be haunted, and maybe still is. Some even said we shouldn't come at all, or something bad might happen...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013805_05": "Those are just rumors!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013805_06": "This place has never actually been haunted.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013805_07": "Really...? I wish that were true. I don't want to be looking over my shoulder for ghosts while trying to enjoy a music festival... Plus, security looks pretty lax around here. I'm seriously worried about my safety if something goes down.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013805_08": "Whatever, I'm already here. No point overthinking it now... Just hope nothing weird happens...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013806_01": "Let me see... Next I need to check the stage flame machine, and the fireworks for tonight...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013806_04": "It might not be the biggest gig I've done, but the vibe's great and the pay's fair! With all the experience I've got, I'll make sure everything's set up just right!",

  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013806_Name_01": "Busy Staff Member",

  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_02": "I see... That was very helpful of you, Wise. Their points are worth thinking about.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_03": "No big names, and the security doesn't seem all that reliable... We've got to fix those. But there's one more thing that's bugging me...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_04": "Did that staff member just say they tripped over nothing? Like, literally nothing in their way?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_05": "I'm worried about this too. Yuzuha, do you think—",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_06": "\"Aaaaahhhhhh!!!\"\nBefore Alice can finish her sentence, a sudden scream rings out from not far away.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_07": "Did... did someone scream again? Don't tell me this isn't over yet...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_08": "...Looks like it. Maybe we let our guard down too soon...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_09": "Let's go see what's going on!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013807_10": "I see... That was very helpful of you, Belle. Their points are worth thinking about.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013808_01": "Sir, please calm down... What you're seeing is just a hologram. It has no physical form. It can't harm you!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013808_02": "No physical form... Then it really <i>is</i> a ghost?! So those posts on Inter-Knot weren't fake after all?!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013808_03": "These aren't ghosts, just virtual projections! See? My hand passes right through them. They can't touch us at all.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013808_04": "And how exactly are you proving they're not ghosts, but just projections? What kind of sane resort would roll out a bunch of spooky projections just to scare people?!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013808_06": "Enough! I don't wanna hear another word! I don't care if they're holograms or whatever. There's something seriously wrong here... I'm checking out right now!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013809_01": "Ma'am, what you're seeing is actually part of our resort's newest attraction — real-time hologram interaction!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013809_02": "So you're telling me this whole bunch of freaky, realistic things that nearly gave people a heart attack is part of your new attraction?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013809_03": "I'm not buying your story! Just get rid of those creepy things right now! If this is all part of your setup, then you must have a way to shut them down!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013809_04": "Sure, no problem, but we just need a little more time...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013809_05": "I knew it. You've got no way to deal with them! These things really are something evil! I can't stay here another second. I'm leaving, right now!",

  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013810_02": "It's all right. Don't be afraid.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013810_03": "These are just holograms.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013810_04": "H-Help me... Th-This is so scary...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013810_05": "She seems to have lost the strength and reason to respond for now. In any case, let's use the camera to locate the hidden hologram projector and retrieve it to put an end to this ghostly display.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013811_02": "It's all right. You're completely safe.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013811_03": "Those images are harmless.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013811_04": "Really...? I was just here to chill, and then suddenly there were all these scary things, one after another... I seriously thought that was the end for me...",

  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013811_06": "We'll take care of this.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013811_07": "O-Okay... but honestly, I just wanna go home now. That last scare nearly gave me a heart attack...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013811_08": "The terrified tourist leaves the scene... Most of the other visitors are reacting the same way, and the situation isn't looking good... Yuzuha, Alice, Manato, and the others seem to have gathered nearby. Let's go find them and discuss our next move.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_01": "Wise, I'm counting on you to find Empy! I asked Fairy to come up with four questions to stall for time, but under this kind of accusation... we won't be able to hold out for long...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_02": "What's with all the whispering over there? You've got time for gossip but not for giving the citizens of New Eridu a straight answer?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_03": "Ugh, this is so annoying! Willis, how did you even know that the projector we mentioned had anything to do with your company's coating materials? We haven't said a word about that yet!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_04": "In the video we just saw, that Penguinboo tiptoed past with the projector and then vanished. That matches the effect of our new coating material perfectly, doesn't it?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_05": "I'm only saying this based on your unprovoked hostility toward me — it's a reasonable assumption that you might use this to smear me. Besides, isn't that beside the point right now?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_06": "...Only three questions left now. Please come back soon, Wise...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_07": "...Only three questions left now. Please come back soon, Belle...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_08": "Tch, how annoying... Willis, how did you even know that the projector we mentioned had anything to do with your company's coating materials? We haven't said a word about that yet.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013812_09": "Belle, I'm counting on you to find Empy! I asked Fairy to come up with four questions to stall for time, but under this kind of accusation... we won't be able to hold out for long...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013814_02": "Huh? Everything's a total mess here, and you're asking about that?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013814_03": "And Penguinboo... isn't it just standing right there by the dock?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013814_04": "There really is a Penguinboo by the dock... Wait, that's not Empy! What's going on? When did a different Penguinboo take its place?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013815_01": "Hi there! Have you seen a Penguinboo around? Looks kinda silly, and it's always off fishing or taking pictures... Sound familiar?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013815_03": "And speaking of Penguinboo... isn't there one over there, near the dock?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013815_04": "But that Penguinboo didn't seem to know anything about fishing or photography... It didn't quite match what you described. I tried talking to it earlier, and all it did was robotically ask if I wanted to go out to sea!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013815_05": "That definitely wasn't the real Empy... But if Empy's gone missing, why is there a Penguinboo here pretending to be it?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_01": "Ehn-nah! (Out to sea? To sea? Sea?)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_02": "You're not Empy.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_04": "En... En-ne! (I'm not actually Empy... Wait, I'm not supposed to say that! I was instructed to call myself Empy for the next half-day! Yes, that's right. I am Empy!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_05": "That lie was way too obvious.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_06": "Impersonating other Bangboo is illegal.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_07": "Na-noo... na... (This can't be happening... Alright, I'm not the Empy you're talking about. But please, don't arrest me! I was just trying to get by...)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_09": "En-na! Noo! (I'm a Bangboo Wanderer. I was roaming the streets this morning, starving! Then this guy just stood in front of me, stared me up and down, and started chatting me up!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_10": "En-nah-nah! (He gave me a bunch of Ether Batteries and said I could have as many as I want if I help him out, so here I am!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_11": "En-nuh! Ehn-na! (He brought me to this resort and told me to stand here pretending to be \"Empy\"! Said if anyone comes by, I should just keep asking if they're going out to sea. That's it, my whole mission! Just standing here!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_12": "En-nah... (I really don't know anything else. I don't even know who Empy is... Um, you can keep the Ether Batteries. Just please... don't arrest me...)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_13": "What did that man look like?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_14": "Ehn-nu-nah! (Oh, I know this one! He wore glasses, had a suit on, and looked kinda rich! Talked all fancy, and sometimes he'd just start muttering to himself for no reason!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_15": "I'm not turning you in.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_16": "But I do need you to stay and be a witness.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_17": "Ehn-nah! (O–Okay! As long as you're not arresting me, I'm open to anything! Also... technically, my job here is to take people out to sea. So... would you like to go for a sail?)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_18": "Now is not the time for this.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_19": "Alright, I'll go fish a bit.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_20": "En-na... (I see... Sorry, I shouldn't have asked that...)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013816_21": "Ehn-nah! (Roger that! I'm on it!)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013817_01": "Mhm-hmm! (Even though I'm not the real Empy, I'll do my job properly all the same! Going out to sea? To sea? Sea?)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013818_01": "What kind of cursed resort is this...? It's not just the creepy things floating in midair that you can't even touch; now there's creepy stuff lurking by the beach too! I should've never come here!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013818_02": "What creepy stuff by the beach?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013818_03": "I have no idea either... I mean, I didn't see anything! I was just walking along the shore a bit earlier, thinking I'd go feel the waves... and then something tripped me out of nowhere!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013818_04": "If it weren't for all the creepy stuff happening around this resort, you'd probably think I was nuts. But I swear, I tripped over something and went face-first into the sand. And when I looked up, there was nothing there!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013818_05": "This is some kind of haunting, isn't it? It has to be!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013818_06": "Where exactly did you trip?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013818_07": "Huh? Lemme think... I guess it was maybe a few dozen meters out from the dock. I can't say exactly where, but if you wander around that area long enough, you're bound to bump into that ghost too!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_02": "From what we've just found out, Willis definitely knows where Empy is... but he didn't say a word, and instead hired some random Bangboo off the street to pose as it...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_03": "Someone tripped over an invisible object in the shallow waters.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_04": "Invisible object? But projectors malfunction when exposed to seawater. There's no way Willis would've set them up out there...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_06": ".............",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_07": "Don't tell me... that invisible object was Empy? And it's been submerged in seawater this whole time...? How could that be...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_08": "That object should be somewhere around here.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_09": "Let's check it out with the camera.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_10": "Mhm... I'm counting on you! Hope it's not too late...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013819_11": "Belle! Have you found any clues over there?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013820_01": "As the camera shutter clicks, Empy the Penguinboo reappears before your eyes, lying limp in the seawater, unconscious, as though it had been struck down.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013820_02": "It's Empy! It's right here! But it seems to be unconscious... I'll check its condition right away!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013820_03": "En-na... (I'm... sorry...)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013820_04": "Empy's waking up... Quick, get it out of the water!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013821_01": "Figures Willis would lash out when cornered... Manato, you go help evacuate the guests with the others. Alice and I will take care of this big guy he summoned!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013821_02": "He never expected to fail, yet still hid a combat mech nearby...? What a shady man. Let's take this chance to put him behind bars for good!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013822_01": "With the mech disabled, Willis is left with no means of resistance. But he no longer seems to care. He sits on the ground, muttering things like \"I'm covered in the coating too. If I stay still, I'll turn invisible, and you won't find me,\" over and over, until the Public Security officers arrive and take him into custody...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013822_02": "Now that is what you'd call being caught red-handed. And thanks to the live broadcast, word should spread quickly that the resort's haunting was nothing more than one of Willis' little schemes.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013822_03": "The crisis has passed. Let's clean up this mess. The tourists are still waiting in the safety zone.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013822_04": "Please wait a moment! There's something I'd like to say...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_01": "I thought the music festival was done for... but hey, who knew it'd come back like this? Kinda lucky, huh~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_02": "Yuzuha, it's too soon to breathe easy! The media coverage is already out, but we've lost a bunch of staff and performers. There's no way we can pull off a full-scale festival like this...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_03": "Then let's bring them back one by one! With my charm as the face of Mystic Wares, I'll definitely get them to change their minds!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_04": "W—We'll help too! With more hands on deck, we might be able to get everything back on track... and maybe even squeeze in a rehearsal before the show!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_05": "Count me in!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_06": "No, Wise, let us handle the rest... After everything we've been through, it's time you got some proper rest.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_07": "Manato's right. And hey Wise, there's actually one more thing you can do~ Just stick around here and welcome our old friends. They'll be rushing over any minute now!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_08": "We'll make sure everything goes smoothly. Just wait for our good news!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_09": "Manato's right. And hey Belle, there's actually one more thing you can do~ Just stick around here and welcome our old friends. They'll be rushing over any minute now!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013823_10": "No, Belle, let us handle the rest... After everything we've been through, it's time you got some proper rest.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013824_01": "Miss Yao was just saying the other day that it's been a while since we've seen you... and now, here you are.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013824_02": "Maybe it's fate.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013824_03": "Yeah. Miss Yao and I watched your entire confrontation with that Three Gates Corp. manager through the livestream. You stayed calm and collected, kept your logic clear, and really put the pressure on. Well done.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013824_05": "Just stating facts. I've dealt with Three Gates Corp. Their middle management's full of guys like him: greedy, ambitious, always clawing their way up. Can't deny it felt good watching him fall.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013824_06": "Anyway, even though the other agency will probably blow up if we turn them down... since Miss Yao wants to perform here, I'll do my best to make it work.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013824_07": "Besides... in this sweltering summer, it's nice to take a short break and catch up with a few friends.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013824_08": "Proxy, it's great to see you. May we all have an unforgettable summer night.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_01": "Wise, you're finally here! Look, I'm wearing that vacation outfit I showed you before! How is it? Feels super summery and perfect for going on stage, doesn't it?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_02": "Looks great on you!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_03": "Hehe... Oh, and guess what? The song I'm performing tonight is the one I sang for you before! So get ready!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_05": "Oh, and this is...?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_06": "Oh right, I almost forgot to introduce her! I've been working on a new song these past couple days, so I was humming the melody in my head while checking out the stage earlier...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_07": "This girl just walked by and, without even thinking, picked up the tune and ran with it — and it sounded amazing! She basically improvised the perfect harmony on the spot! So of course I had to come talk to her!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_08": "N—No... It's nothing... I just kinda... sorta hummed along...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_09": "She's gonna short-circuit from nerves at this rate...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_10": "But that melody really surprised me! Do you do music too? What's your name?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_11": "I... I'm in a... band right now... We're called... called \"Angels of Dilution\" — oh wait no, that came out wrong...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_12": "No need to be so nervous! Here's an idea — come stand right in the front row when the show starts, and I'll make sure we have tons of fun interacting, okay? Oh, and let's add each other on Knock Knock too!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_13": "Please — definitely! Here on this paper are my Knock Knock ID, our band's Knock Knock ID, and our official socials, and please sign it for me!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_14": "Where'd all that shyness go?!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_15": "Sure thing! Hehe, looks like we're new friends now, Miss Super-Talented Composer~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_16": "Alright then, Belle, could you help me bring her up to the front later? Eve and I gotta go get stage-ready. Thanks! See you in a bit!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_17": "Alright then, Wise, could you help me bring her up to the front later? Eve and I gotta go get stage-ready. Thanks! See you in a bit!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_18": "Hehe... Oh, and the song I'm performing tonight? I actually gave your brother a little sneak peek a while back! So get ready!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_19": "Belle, you're finally here! I'm wearing that vacation outfit I showed you before! How does it look? Super summery, right? Perfect for the stage!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013825_Name_01": "Shy Girl",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_01": "Wise, we're not too late, are we? It took us a bit to sort through the case files, and then we hit traffic on the way over. Seems like a lot of people are heading to the resort...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_02": "Right on time.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_03": "Manager, even though they say, \"Never judge someone by who they used to be\"... I didn't expect you to pull off such a thriving new business in the Throne Quarter. Clearly, you're not to be underestimated.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_05": "It's a legitimate business!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_06": "I know. I'm just kidding. As they say, \"spring makes you drowsy, autumn wears you out, and summer puts you straight to sleep.\" This muggy heat's been knocking me out at the precinct too... I figured it was time to step out and get some fresh air.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_07": "You can go fishing here!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_09": "Qingyi, you... Oh, isn't that a... shooting booth over there?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_10": "That's our original shooting game.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_13": "Hmm, it seems Zhu Yuan's quite intrigued.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013826_14": "Belle, we're not too late, are we? It took us a bit to sort through the case files, and then we hit traffic on the way over. Seems like a lot of people are heading to the resort...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_03": "Has it really been that long? Didn't we just talk on video a moment ago?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_05": "Hello, Proxy. It's been a while. I've arranged some time off for everyone in Section 6. On a rare, clear summer night like this, this place is perfect for unwinding and recovering from the strain of work.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_06": "Strangely enough, Asaba and Soukaku wandered off on their own the moment we arrived, like it wasn't their first time here...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_09": "I heard you've been through quite a few adventures lately. If you're up for it, let's find a quiet place later tonight and take our time catching up.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_10": "And it seems Nicole from Cunning Hares is coming too... Perfect. I've been meaning to catch up with her, too. After all, it was on a night just like this that she tricked \"Tailless\" out of my hands for the first time.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_11": "(Good luck, Nicole...)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_12": "I'd also like to get a drink and unwind a bit... but before that, I need to find Soukaku first. As for Asaba... well, since we're officially on break, he can enjoy it however he likes...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013827_13": "Belle, we're here.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_02": "Nom nom... Hi Proxy, want a burger?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_03": "You two are so chill...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_04": "Already switched to vacation mode, huh?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_05": "A chance to chill at the resort for free? As if we Cunning Hares would ever pass that up! Billy and Nekomata already split up to grab snacks and drinks, and then we're claiming those lounge chairs till the sun goes down!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_06": "Are you coming with us, Proxy? I heard the Sailboat Drink Stand does movie screenings. Maybe we could pick one and watch it together.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_07": "Got a few things to take care of.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_08": "I'll catch you in a bit!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_09": "Don't forget to come grab a drink or two once you're done, alright? You've been hosting us here, so drinks are on me later!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_10": "Thinking back to last year's Camellia Golden Week... we actually spent it at your place, didn't we? Hard to believe how time flies.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_11": "Nicole, save the nostalgia for later... Billy just messaged. He said there are so many tourists at the resort, the shop's already out of drinks.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_12": "...Huh?! Anby, drop that burger and get up! We gotta go back to the parking lot and get those boxes of drinks from our trunk!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_13": "No vacation anymore?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013828_14": "Business is right in front of us. Who's got time for a vacation?! Chop chop, get those drinks out to the crowd! Look, Dennies are calling my name!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_01": "Yo, Proxy! Long time no see! The Belobog crew has been vacationing here these past few days, but we haven't run into you till now!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_02": "Having a good time on your vacation?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_03": "It's been truly relaxing. Thanks to your invitation, we've been able to fully unwind from all the busy work at the company and get some proper rest these past few days!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_04": "Thanks for taking care of my drones, Proxy, and for sharing all that feedback on how they handled! After these past few days, I think I've got a pretty good idea of how to improve these kids!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_05": "Oh, and about that haunting you mentioned earlier... it's been sorted out now, right?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_06": "Wait, what? I had no idea that even happened... I must've been too busy swimming and catching up on sleep. Proxy, tell me who it was — I'll make sure they regret it!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_07": "No worries, it's all taken care of.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_08": "That guy's over at the PubSec precinct now.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_09": "Already got caught...? That's way too easy! Whatever his reason was, anyone who dares ruin someone else's summer break deserves to carry three full cartloads of bricks. With their bare hands!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_10": "Easy, sweet pea. From the look on Proxy's face, whoever was behind it probably already paid the price. Let's leave all that behind. For now, we've got a summer night to enjoy!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013829_11": "Yeah... you're right. Proxy, let's forget all that mess for tonight! Ben and Anton went fishing, so why don't we have a beachside fish BBQ party later?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_01": "I can finally take a breather... There's just way too much to do!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_02": "Good thing everything's ready. Makes me feel a bit more at ease...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_03": "Thanks for setting that up!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_04": "Let's sit back and wait for the show to begin!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_05": "Time for the show to begin... It still feels like we only decided to hold the festival a minute ago. So much has happened over the past few days... and soon, it'll be time to head back to school.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_06": "...Milady, are you for real? We're still on break! If you keep talking about school and classes all the time, your hair's gonna go asymmetrical, y'know?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_07": "Wh—What?! But going to class is a student's duty...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_09": "Alright... I'm sorry. I know I say things I shouldn't sometimes. It's just... I've never really had friends before. Not ones I could truly open up to. So I'm still figuring out how to be with people like this...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_10": "It's fine, so no need to be all timid~! And hey, this summer break might be ending, but we can always hit the beach together next year! Just don't tell me you're staying home to study~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_11": "...I'll definitely be there. It's a promise! Wise, you'll come too, right?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_12": "Definitely!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_13": "Next year's vacation is already on my list!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_14": "You two better not go back on your word~ Or else! I'll have Kama sneak into your kitchen and replace every last drink with bitter melon juice!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013830_15": "...I'll definitely be there. It's a promise! Belle, you'll come too, right?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_01": "Wise, did you say hi to our friends already? Look, the music festival's kicking off soon!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_02": "Yup, caught up with all of them.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_03": "Aw, seeing everyone again must've brought back some memories, huh? But hey, now it's time to hang out with your adorable sister!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_04": "Sure thing! Time to enjoy this break together!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_05": "Hehe, I brought my camera, so let's capture all the best moments tonight! Don't worry, Wise, I'll make sure you look extra cool and cheerful in the shots! Come on, let's head to the festival!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_07": "I want to wander around a bit.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_08": "Mhm, I brought my camera too, so we can try to capture all the best moments tonight. Don't worry, Belle, I'll do my best to get some nice shots of you — ones you'll actually like... So, ready for the festival?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_09": "It's been a while since we've seen them. Feels kinda nostalgic, doesn't it? But for now, if you don't mind, I hope you'll spare a little more attention for your poor brother who's been left alone.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013831_10": "Belle, did you say hi to our friends already? Look, the music festival's kicking off soon!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_01": "..So it's done? We went through a lot, but I'm glad it all ended well.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_02": "Did you have a good time, Manato?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_03": "Of course. Spending a rather peaceful day by the sea, with the breeze in your face and a cold drink in hand — who could possibly say no to that?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_04": "Huh? Are you actually calling today \"rather peaceful\"?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_05": "Willis and his gang can be a real headache when they act up... but with you guys around, dealing with them isn't much of a hassle.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_06": "As our first team-building event since Alice joined Spook Shack... Yuzuha really pulled it off perfectly. Wise, I hope you're enjoying everything we've planned for this summer too.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_07": "I had a great time!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_09": "Mhm, if you've got any more plans coming up, just let me know. I'll make time.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013832_10": "As our first team-building event since Alice joined Spook Shack... Yuzuha really pulled it off perfectly. Belle, I hope you're enjoying everything we've planned for this summer too.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013833_02": "And... and she even said I'm a super-talented composer!!!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013833_03": "It was like a dream... Just wait till I tell those two — they'll totally be jealous!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013833_04": "Hmph, that's what they get for not coming to the beach with me!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013833_Name_01": "Shy Girl",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_01": "Proxy, I heard you ran into some trouble at the resort, and someone was using large machinery to launch attacks... Are you okay? Did you get hurt?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_03": "How did you know I was at the resort, Trigger?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_05": "Anyway, Soldier 11 and I were worried about you and the other Proxy... so we asked Captain Magus for some time off to check on you. I'm just glad you're okay. You really had me scared there...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_07": "Blazing Ocean Breeze, I'm not like Trigger — I know you're capable enough to handle things. That said, I do wonder what really happened here.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_08": "(Explain what happened)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_09": "I see... But the answer seemed kind of obvious. What made it take so long to figure out that the projector could go invisible?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_10": "It's not that obvious...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_11": "Making something invisible is still pretty hard with today's technology...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_12": "Oh, really? But Seed got it working pretty easily a while ago. These days, Seed Sr. usually turns invisible when he's standing still... I even bump into him sometimes.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_13": "Wait, what?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_14": "How did she even do that?!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_15": "About that... we don't really know how it works either. When we asked Seed, she just said something like, \"First you do this, then that, and then this-and-that, and alright, invisible.\"",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_16": "There were a few companies that came looking for her, but she really disliked dealing with those types, so every time, she'd just go invisible to avoid them. Honestly, she might be the only one who knows how that even works...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_17": "Just who is Seed, really...?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_18": "Anyway, looks like you handled the situation perfectly. Since our leave's already been approved... let's celebrate tonight with some super spicy noodles!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_19": "There's no noodle place around here... but since it's been a while, how about we go get some Nitro-Fuel instead? You did spill yours yesterday, after all — maybe this can make up for that little mishap.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013834_20": "(Something feels off...)",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_01": "Hey Manager, I was wondering why you weren't at the video store lately. So this is where you've started your new career, huh... Say, that membership card I topped up before... can I still use it here~?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_02": "Totally!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_03": "You've always been on our VIP list!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_04": "You're quite the smooth talker, Manager. When you get back to the video store, I'll have to renew my yearly membership~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_05": "By the way, Jane, were you the one who cracked those thugs...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_06": "during the interrogation?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_07": "That's right. I heard you needed their testimonies, so I gave them a little \"nudge.\"",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_08": "They were pretty tight-lipped at first, but with a bit of prisoner's dilemma and some psychological tricks, they started cracking, one by one~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_10": "Glad it didn't ruin your vacation. If trouble comes up again, feel free to find me. I've got a few tricks up my sleeve... as long as you're not too hung up on the rules.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_12": "You're not going with Zhu Yuan and the others...?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_13": "Hanging out with three PubSec Officers in a crowded place like this... doesn't really feel like my scene. Were you worried I'd be bored on my own, Manager?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013835_14": "That's sweet of you. But I do have a fix for that... How about you join me for a few drinks~?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013836_02": "How about you, Lucy? Having fun?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013836_03": "I-It's... just okay! Though it can't compare to riding in the Outer Ring... the sea breeze at night's kinda nice, the hotel's comfy, and the festival had a few songs I actually liked...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013836_04": "Looks like you're having a good time.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013836_05": "Urgh...!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013836_06": "Fine, let's just say that... I modified your surf courses and boards, so I totally deserve this relaxing vacation!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013836_07": "Burnice and the others are still chugging away like there's no tomorrow. At this rate, they'll probably keep going past 3 a.m... But I'm not about to go wild with them. Staying up late is a beauty's worst enemy.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013836_09": "It's my pleasure~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_01": "I-I don't want to go back...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_02": "Huh? Speak up — it's too noisy in here. I can't hear you!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_03": "I said I don't want to go back to school!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_05": "I don't want to go back to school!!! I want to stay at the resort and have fun with you all!!!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_06": "Now I heard that loud and clear! What a bad student bunny — but I guess I'm no better!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_09": "I just wanna stay with everyone forever!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_10": "{M#Belle, I ate your pudding!}{F#Wise, I played with your model!}",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_11": "Hey ocean, are you listening?! Don't let Wise go back to work!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_12": "Hey ocean, are you listening?! Don't let Belle go back to work!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_13": "W—We feel the same!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_15": "Wise... Belle's nearby, and she's heard everything, you know?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013837_16": "Belle... Wise's nearby, and he's heard everything, you know?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013838_01": "Tonight was a blast, Wise! It really feels like it made up for not being able to go on that vacation during Camellia Golden Week!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013838_04": "I wanna look around some more!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013838_05": "Yeah! Nighty night, Wise!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013838_07": "Alrighty, I'll wait for you here~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013838_08": "Alright then, I'll wait for you here.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013838_09": "Guess all that excitement's finally catching up... I'm actually a little drowsy... even with all that Nitro-Fuel. Should we call it a night?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_01": "Good morning, Wise!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_02": "Morning! What were you talking about?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_03": "We were just talking about how the resort's short-term operating rights are about to expire~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_04": "Yeah, I guess it really is almost up...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_05": "Time flies...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_06": "Regarding this matter... According to the agreement, your short-term operating rights to the resort will soon revert back to us, but...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_07": "...Might I ask you to consider staying on and helping us manage the resort long-term? Of course, there would be no further fees involved this time... We sincerely hope you'll continue your connection with Fantasy Resort for many days to come!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_08": "If it weren't for your help, this place would've likely fallen into Willis' hands long ago... You're not just our friends, but the ones who saved this resort. Miss Therese, the staff, and I all believe that this place needs you.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_10": "...Mr. Ege, Miss Therese, I suppose we don't really need any more revenue from the resort... We'd prefer to cover Spook Shack's expenses through our own efforts.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_11": "But I also believe... the connection we've built won't simply end with the short-term agreement. We really enjoy being here, and we love the atmosphere. It's not a place we can just walk away from.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_12": "So please — allow us to take part in the resort's long-term future!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_13": "That's such a classic Alice answer!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_14": "Yup, what Alice said goes for all of us~!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_15": "That's a relief! I was worried you might say no... So once again, looking forward to working with you all!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_17": "Thanks, Therese! These are really good... Just looking at them brings back all those moments from last night!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_18": "...Hey, bunny, quit that silly grinning. Everyone's watching you.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_19": "I–I wasn't! I mean... okay, fine, I was smiling. But only because I'm really happy! I'm going to hang this photo by my bed... so I can see all of you first thing every morning!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_20": "I'll do the same!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013839_21": "Well well... Great minds think alike~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_01": "Wise, Yuzuha and Alice said you know a thing or two about navigating the Hollows... Is that true?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_02": "Oh, just a thing or two.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_03": "Did something happen?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_04": "Actually... In the audio where Willis' crimes were exposed, he mentioned Midsummer's research data... the data my father left behind.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_05": "You probably know this, but before Midsummer shifted to tourism and started building resorts... it used to be on par with Three Gates in military tech. Though I've never seen the actual research myself... I imagine it must be quite valuable.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_06": "It wasn't until I heard that recording that I realized... the resort was just a cover. What Willis really wanted was to snatch Midsummer's secret data and use it to boost himself up.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_07": "But he probably never guessed the research wasn't here at all. Everything he did was for nothing, because Father had already hidden it deep in a Hollow.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_08": "How do you know that?!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_09": "I only found out recently... There was a hidden compartment in the bracelet my father left me, and inside were two small slips of paper, each with a Hollow coordinate...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_10": "If the research data is real, it must be tied to those two coordinates.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_11": "Hollow coordinates change all the time.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_12": "So you'll need someone who can navigate.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_13": "Yeah... Could you help me check those two coordinates, and bring back whatever my father might've left behind? I've already told Yuzuha and Alice, and they said they're willing to help too.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_14": "I'm not really interested in the research... but since it was my father's, I'd still like to have it back in my own hands.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_15": "I got this!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_16": "Thanks! Yuzuha and Alice should be somewhere around here... I'll send you the coordinates. Once you've worked out the location, go talk to them.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_17": "Belle, Yuzuha and Alice said you know a thing or two about navigating the Hollows... Is that true?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013901_Name_01": "Therese",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_01": "Hey Wise, Therese talked to you about the Hollow treasure hunt already, didn't she?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_02": "Does that count as a Hollow treasure hunt?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_03": "Of course it does~ We've been stuck battling outside the Hollows for ages. It's been way too long since we had a proper adventure in there... And that's where all the real ghost stories hang out!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_04": "Decoding that coordinate should be a piece of cake for you, right? So, ready to head out now?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_05": "Let's go treasure hunting!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_06": "Wait a sec.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_07": "Hey Belle, Therese talked to you about the Hollow treasure hunt already, didn't she?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013902_Name_01": "Ukinami Yuzuha",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013903_01": "Wise... Therese must've asked you to help recover her father's belongings too, right? Shall we head out now?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013903_02": "It sounds like this really matters to you.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013903_03": "Naturally. It could very well be something her father left behind... If it's hidden in a Hollow, then it's only right we try to find it — for her sake, as her friends!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013903_04": "I trust you've already decoded the coordinates? Let's head out together, then.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013903_05": "For our friend, let's go!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013903_06": "Wait a sec.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013903_07": "Belle... I assume Therese has asked you to help recover her father's belongings as well? Shall we head out now?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013904_01": "Why are there a bunch of Hollow Raiders wandering around here...? Don't tell me they're after the research data too?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013904_02": "Everyone in New Eridu saw that livestream and heard Willis mention the research data. So yeah, it's no surprise someone's after it... But they weren't supposed to have the coordinates...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013904_03": "Eh, forget it — no point wondering about that. According to the new coordinates you calculated, this should be where Therese's father hid it! Let's bring it back~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013904_Name_01": "Ukinami Yuzuha",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013905_01": "Why's there a lone Typhon in the Hollow...? Did someone put it here on purpose?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013905_02": "If this mech was left by Therese's father... was it meant to guard this place? To prevent intruders?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013905_03": "Anyway, there's definitely something at this coordinate... Let's bring it back and see what it is.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_01": "You show Therese the two files you brought out of the Hollow...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_02": "Thank you... Thank you all... So these are what my father left behind...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_03": "Two files...? It doesn't feel like they're both research data... Or maybe neither of them is...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_04": "Let's just open them and take a look.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_05": "In that case, how about we open the one I found first? I've got a feeling it might be better to save Alice's for later~",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_06": "...Alright. Please! Actually, after you left, I looked it up on Inter-Knot, and found that the coordinate Yuzuha has... it's been floating around for years now.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_07": "So that's how it is. No wonder we ran into a bunch of Hollow Raiders there. I guess the file I have probably isn't all that classified after all—",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_08": "Yuzuha opens the file in her hands. It's filled with messy, scribbled handwriting, all sorts of childish wishes like \"I want to be an astronaut.\" Therese snatches it back, her face turning bright red.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_09": "What was Dad thinking...? Th—This is my childhood diary... Why would he put this in the Hollow...?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_10": "Well, I've got a feeling you'll get your answer after reading Alice's file. Alice?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_11": "Alice opens the file in her hands. As the pages unfold, a flood of obscure academic terms spills into view. There's no doubt — this must be the research data.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_12": "These... are...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_13": "He left two coordinates, one real, one fake, and spread the fake while he was still alive... That way, if someone got both later, they'd likely think they were both traps.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_14": "And with a combat machine guarding the true coordinate... he ensured no one else could take the data — at least not until the day you were strong enough to retrieve it yourself.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_15": "He was thinking about all this... eleven years ago?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_16": "...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_17": "Alice, would you be willing to take the research data?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_18": "...H—Huh?!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_19": "I know it's from eleven years ago, but Midsummer was once a respected name in military tech, and the groundwork they laid was solid. If it ends up in the Thymefield family's hands, I'm sure it'll be put to much better use.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_20": "But... why? Isn't this something your father left behind for you?",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_21": "It is. But that's why I'd rather it go to someone who can truly make use of it. I didn't get my father's gift for research at all... Maybe this resort, this place, is what he really meant to leave for me.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_22": "Alice, I know things haven't been easy for your family lately. If what's in here can help you in any way... then I think this journey was worth it.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_23": "Go on, take it, Alice.",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_24": "Mhm... Thank you. I'll bring it back and look through it with my fellow researchers!",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_25": "Alice takes the research file from Therese. As she does, a single slip of paper slides out and drifts to the ground. You pick it up and find a few lines of handwritten text. It looks like a casual note, written by someone over a decade ago...",
  "Activity_Chat_EndlessSummer_600013906_26": "<i>\"Took a walk along the beach with Therese today. We ran into a rabbit Thiren father with his daughter. I recognized him... He'd introduced himself at the banquet a few days ago as a scholar of Ether science, from a noble family.\"</i>",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_17": "No, no, not like that, but close. I'm a program director at NEBC. We were filming a beach-themed show nearby, and I happened to see your amazing surfing skills.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_18": "Especially that thrilling move at the end!! It's exactly what our show is all about. Would it be possible to film some footage of you surfing, to use as promotional material for our show?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_19": "Looks like you won't have to become a trainee.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_20": "You could totally debut on a reality show now.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_21": "Uh... that's a little exaggerated... But rest assured, you'll definitely get fair compensation for your time!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_22": "That won't be necessary. Just make sure to feature our resort and help promote our \"Blazing Waves\" experience.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_23": "No problem, we'll sync up with the sponsors about this request. It shouldn't be an issue.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_24": "If the response is good, we'll have a pilot episode livestream event in two days, and we hope you can join us.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_25": "Well, well, well! Perfect timing! What do you say, Alice? You're about to get a crazy amount of exposure!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_26": "Huh, you want me to be on TV? I'm really not that professional, are you sure it's okay?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_27": "Don't worry, if you show off those water skills like you just did, the audience will be totally blown away.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_28": "Uh, okay. Thank you, Mr. Director!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_29": "Thank you! I'll get the filming crew over right away. And Miss Alice, you can start getting ready too.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260003_30": "Before long, the crew had set up cameras, monitors, and other equipment along the shore. This must be what a professional team looks like.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260005_02": "What are you guys talking about?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260005_03": "Who's this surfer girl you're talking about?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260005_06": "Yeah, that's her! She's blowing up right now as the \"Heatwave Bunny\". Look, the NEBC's video just dropped half an hour ago, and it's already hit a million views.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260005_07": "Heatwave... Bunny?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260005_08": "Ohhhh, the name caught on thanks to a meme in the comment section.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_03": "Looks like Alice's surfing video went viral.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_08": "Yeah, that was super dangerous just now!",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_10": "I just thought about how much heart and soul everyone's put into this resort. I don't want to pass up a good chance to promote it.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_11": "Alright, alright, our tough little carrot. But you nearly drowned today, let's just head back to the room and get some rest, okay?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_12": "Yeah, whatever it is, we can deal with it tomorrow.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_17": "She was so confident during practice...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_20": "Don't worry, Proxy! When have I ever come up with a sketchy plan?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_21": "(Her terrible ideas from before flash vividly through my mind...)",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260006_22": "(On second thought, better keep that to myself)",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_05": "Don't interrupt! You have no idea how bad the signal is in the bathroom while sorting this stuff out, how cold the floor gets, or how hard it was to take notes.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_06": "I digress... Anyway, this is the ultimate guide to positive energy, the source of confidence!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_07": "Ta-da! \"The Book of Praise\"!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_08": "Yuzuha pulled out a notebook with \"The Book of Praise\" scrawled messily across the cover.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_09": "Any one of these phrases will give Alice a huge boost of positive energy. If we cheer her on with these words while she's practicing surfing, she'll definitely rebuild her confidence.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_13": "Quick! Pick a line in here! Make sure to shout it out loud when the time comes!",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_21": "Oh, right, Proxy, there's one more thing I need your help with. We just reached out to a friend from the Outer Ring, hoping she can act as a mentor and help guide Alice through her mental struggles.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_22": "We figured those biker gangs, with all their revving engines and wild riding, might have the kind of bold, fearless spirit that could give Alice some real positive motivation.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_23": "But she just kept working on the wave machine and rejected us without even turning around.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260007_24": "Are you guys looking for Lucy?",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260008_07": "Ugh, this damn thing is impossible to fix. Surf? How are you supposed to surf when the wave machine's busted? You'd better just go chase the tides instead.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260008_08": "Looking at the panel, it seems to be just a tuning issue.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260008_09": "Can I take a look?",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260012_08": "Let's go find out what's going on.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260012_10": "Huh? No, I didn't! I'm also confused about why so many people suddenly showed up.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260013_04": "What's up? Wanna learn how to slide tackle? Let me tell you, once you master this move, forget surfing—it's great for self-defense too. Tigers, lions, nothing will stand a chance. Back in my day, I...",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260018_01": "Wow, who would've thought? The livestream's viewer count just broke NEBC's all-time record, and the top trending searches are all praising Alice.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260018_04": "Yeah, all thanks to Alice. After so many ups and downs in just a few days, the outcome turned out pretty great. Helen said all the upcoming surfing classes are fully booked.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260018_07": "And now you're acting surprised?",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260021_08": "After eating her fill, Yuzuha passed out right on the counter—probably didn't get much rest this afternoon while preparing the cake. Therese helped escort her back to her room, and everyone else started cleaning up the mess at the drinks stand.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260022_04": "Sure, what do I need to get ready?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260022_05": "Don't be scared! Even I managed to get over my fears! Let me think... how should I teach you?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260022_07": "Isn't that kind of... not elegant?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260022_08": "I was just kidding! Since when did you start picking up my elegance...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_35260022_10": "You don't need to prepare anything! Hmm... what should I teach you first?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013601_03": "Like snapping your sword into an asymmetric shape.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013601_05": "Yeah, so we've got to find Yuzuha.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013601_07": "What should I do, Belle? What if she never talks to me again?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013602_01": "Ugh...",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013602_13": "Very well. I'll cover all the activities at the beach today!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013602_14": "Cover for what? Silly bunny, we're running the resort now! Try out some of the coolest activities and help draw a crowd for us!",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013603_16": "Okay, please check your gear. We're heading out.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013603_17": "Alright, speed-shooting challenge, let's go!",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013604_19": "Manato said he was installing a TV at the drinks stand.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013604_20": "Maybe we could use that to play it.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013606_05": "A collector's edition of \"Two Kilometers Under the Sea\"?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013606_11": "No, he just told us to get a shooting card from your counter.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013607_05": "The one who filmed it? Closer than you think — that's me! This is none other than my \"Sea Spirit Chronicles\" footage. A creature with the wisdom of humans and the body of a fish. Fascinating, right?",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013607_07": "What, you wanna go find them?",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013607_10": "Hold up, Yuzuha! Remember that Sixth Street cat spirit legend from last time? That pink-haired shop owner said the same thing, then tried to sell us some \"cat spirit viewing tickets\" and scammed me out of 20,000 Dennies...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013607_11": "Besides, keeping a legendary creature as a pet? That's just ridiculous no matter how you look at it.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013607_14": "Sure, I can let you take a look. But listen, kid — there's no such thing as a free lunch in this world. I don't care much about making money myself, but it'd mean a lot if you could show a little support for Mia's stall.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_10": "Um, just because I said we can go fishing doesn't mean I actually know how to fish.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_11": "Look at Manato",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_12": "Uh, don't tell anyone about this. I'm actually... kinda afraid of water.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_13": "Look at Alice",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_14": "Ugh, don't look at me! There's zero fishing talent in my family. Back in the day, they used to call my dad \"Captain Skunk\" because he couldn't catch a thing.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_15": "What about your grandpa?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_16": "And they used to call my grandpa \"Admiral Skunk\"...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_17": "Yeah, yeah, yeah, you all have your reasons.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013613_19": "Hey, what are you doing?! If you're hungry, just go fishing!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_00": "You hurry to pull the \"mermaid\" onto the boat, and to your surprise, you see a familiar face...",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_03": "Why were you sleeping behind the reef?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_04": "Oh, Victoria Housekeeping Co. got a commission from Fantasy Resort to help supervise some service details and stuff.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_05": "Mr. Lycaon sent me to check the shark nets in nearby waters.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_06": "I found a spot on the reef that looked just like a sofa, so I decided to lie down and try it out. That's when you guys came and carried me back.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_07": "Oh, that kinda makes sense.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_08": "Makes sense? How?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_09": "You skipped the most important part - sleeping!",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_16": "Let's head back first and get some answers from that weird old man!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_17": "After a long journey, you finally arrive at the beach pier. As soon as you step off, Yuzuha, clearly fuming, leads everyone straight to Ahab's little shop...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_200": "Wait a minute! I think I just saw something!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013614_201": "Behind that reef! There's a mermaid!!!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013615_03": "This mermaid might not be what you expected...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013615_15": "Uh, Grandpa Ahab, this mermaid might be a bit different from what we expected.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013616_01": "If we're going to enter the Hollow by sea, we'll probably need a bigger ship to ensure stability and safety.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013616_05": "Yuzuha, are you listening?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013616_06": "Next comes the final step.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013616_07": "Mhm, let's go! Let's borrow a ship from Captain Empy and set sail!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013617_09": "Maybe I can help.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013618_01": "Ehn-na-na... (Think, think! What if they fix the ship...)",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013618_02": "Alright, it's done.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013618_03": "Ehn-na-nah? (Already?)",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013618_04": "Ehn-ne, ehn-nah-nu. (Already? With skills like that, why are you even looking into ghost stories? You could probably work for HSO already.)",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013618_05": "Oh no, no. I'm just average.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013618_06": "I'm just an amateur, know a little bit here and there.",

  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013619_03": "What's on your mind?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013621_05": "Whether the result is real or not.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013621_06": "The thrill in the process must be real!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013621_07": "Yeah, I think Yuzuha would be really happy, too.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013621_08": "Well, that old man might not be very reliable, but the location he gave us was a huge help.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013621_09": "Speaking of which, Manato and I stopped by his shop to say thanks, but he wasn't there.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013621_10": "If he's not at his own shop...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_04": "Uh, Grandpa, you've got visitors.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_05": "Hi Mr. Ahab... How are you doing?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_06": "You... you kids! You're just looking for trouble, aren't you? The Hollow's no place to be messing around!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_07": "What if something went wrong? What if you couldn't make it back? Even if you don't care about yourselves, you should think about the people working with you to run this resort!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_08": "Therese and Mia were so worried, Ege even thought you'd kidnapped Empy.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_09": "(Does he really think we'd do that?)",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_10": "Sorry, Grandpa Ahab, for making you worry.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_11": "Forget it. So did you really...?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_12": "The old man opens his mouth, then hesitates, eyes flickering with curiosity and fear. When he glances at Mia, his furrowed brow slowly begins to relax.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_13": "Ah, never mind. As long as you're all safe, that's what matters. Let's leave it at that.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_14": "For a moment, you're not sure whether to tell him the truth. In the end, you decide to respect his choice.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_15": "If you really want to thank me, help talk some sense into Mia. She's too stubborn.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_16": "Grandpa! How can you talk about me like that right in front of my boss! I'm not going back for dinner tonight!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_17": "*sigh* You! Miss Thymefield, you must be the real big boss behind this resort.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_18": "Could you help me talk some sense into her?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_19": "What? Me? You're talking to me?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_20": "Proxy, Yuzuha's still waiting for you at the aquarium. I think there's a lot she wants to tell you.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013622_21": "Alice and I can handle things here. You go check on her.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_02": "How did you know that mermaids need to sing to move forward?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_03": "Stop when the music stops?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_04": "Isn't it just \"Net's Up, Net's Down\"? Come on, Proxy, don't tell me you've never played it before.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_06": "Isn't it \"Red Light, Green Light\"?",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_11": "Yeah...",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_12": "I hope she can make more friends.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_13": "Well, after all this, I'd say you're an unofficial member of Spook Shack now.",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_14": "I never agreed to that!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013623_15": "I'm worth a fortune, you know!",
  "Activity_Chat_Summer_600013651_01": "Well, wanna watch me take on \"Legends of the Deep\" and totally crush it?",
  "Activity_Chat_TheGoldenMechaGodBattle_702923001_02": "Heard it at the noodle shop again?",
  "Activity_Chat_TowerGlory_30160125_08": "At least he kept his word.",
  "Activity_Chat_TowerGlory_30160128_10": "Yeah! And that's not all - to amp up the immersion and engagement during the Battle Trial, we've thoughtfully brought over both the boss battle arenas and their stats~",
  "Activity_Chat_TowerGlory_30160128_15": "So you brought me here for...",
  "Activity_Chat_TowerGlory_30160128_19": "After that, whoever it was completely breached our Battle Trial system...",
  "Activity_Chat_TowerGlory_30160128_25": "Do I look like a super hacker to you?",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_01": "What a beautiful summer! Sunshine, beaches, and...",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_02": "...Phew, I'm so tired all of a sudden. I just keep repeating these lines... Will anyone actually buy this?",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_03": "If we really wanna attract more tourists to Fantasy Resort, we should just be straight about what makes this place worth visiting.",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_04": "For example, drink special milkshakes and gaze at the sea under the sunlight. Or stroll along the waves at sunset, admiring the golden coastline under the setting sun... That's what everyone wants to experience.",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_07": "But every time I excitedly finish telling these stories, most people just think I'm some shill sent by a travel agency, worried that I'm about to shove a \"Special Deals and Recommendations\" flyer into their hands.",

  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_09": "And that little Bangboo tilted its head and pretended to listen to me, but really just wanted to ask where the nearest charging station was.",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_10": "The other two were pretty interested at first, but the moment they heard it was interactive, they started playing hot potato and bailed.",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_11": "Could it be... that no one's interested in my carefully crafted Photo Restoration minigame?",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_14": "Er, to hype people up, I turned some photos I took during my trip to Fantasy Resort and the surrounding areas into a puzzle game.",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_15": "Complete all my themed puzzle sets, and you'll get your hands on...",

  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_19": "For example, do you know what flavor of shark cup milkshake tastes best with a sandwich? Do you know what is the right hour to go to the beach for the most beautiful sunset?",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_20": "You can find all the answers in my guidebook!",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_21": "What do you say? Wanna give it a shot? You might just be the first one to snag this guide!",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_22": "I'll give it a shot",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_23": "Maybe next time",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053001_24": "(And here I thought the reward would be free access to attractions...)",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053002_02": "Gonna take a look now",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053002_03": "Later",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053006_01": "I knew I'd find you here! My guidebook is pretty awesome, isn't it?",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053006_02": "Speaking of which, I really need to thank you for helping wrap up the tourism promotion event so perfectly.",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053006_03": "For some reason, ever since you started taking on the Photo Restoration challenge, more and more citizens have been joining in... Could this be what they call the bandwagon effect?",
  "Activity_Chat_jigsaw3.0_600053006_04": "Still, you're the fastest one out of everyone — next time we hold an event like this, you've definitely gotta come and join us!",

He doesn't want to drag us into it, but intends to \"break through to enlightenment\" ... Oh, and he also said, \"worry not for me, my young friends.\"",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161801_013": "Then he just bolted. I searched everywhere, but I couldn't find him! What's with this \"chosen one\" stuff? And I don't think I've ever heard Shifu mention anything as dire as an \"unavoidable fate\"...",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161801_016": "He sounds like he's going through....that phase. Senior Fufu, you've heard of it, right? That phase where people think they have some grand destiny or special mission in life?",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161801_017": "A phase? \"Grand destiny\"? He didn't say anything like that when he came to me for training advice...",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161801_019": "And after coming to the temple, he's always been diligent, never slacking off, not even a little. It's all my fault... I've been so focused on rebuilding the temple that I haven't taken time to check in on him or his training... I've been a terrible senior!",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_003": "Hmm, that's probably Belion...",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_009": "Not being able to do more...? Back at Yunkui Summit, Bolion was always one of our hardest workers. He trained so diligently, and never once turned anyone down when they asked for help...",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_010": "I haven't been around him much lately so I'm not sure what was eating at him...",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_013": "I remember I casually said something like, \"If only everyone could be as strong as Shifu, then she wouldn't have to carry the burden every time something happens.\" Could it be... Bolion took that to heart?",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_014": "And maybe that made him think he's not strong enough... and pushed him to train harder.",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_053": "Have you ever encountered anything like this before?",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_060": "Oh, no, no! It's fine as long as he's not in danger. He's been living out there all alone for a while now... it must be rough.",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_062": "I believe he'll go back on his own when he's ready. To him, home is where everyone from Yunkui Summit is, after all.",
  "Activity_GalGame_BangBooAB_10161802_063": "Let's go talk to Bolion now. I'd love to ask him to teach me his ways! Th—This game stuff is a little brainy for me, but I still want to join him on his training!",

  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161905_001": "I can't believe how fast the haunting rumors spread... We worked so hard to turn this place around... if this keeps up, it could scare people off all over again...",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161906_007": "Wise, you were the one who gave me the idea. On the ship, you said \"déjà vu is a signal from our subconscious, don't ignore that feeling\"... so I started thinking carefully about where this deja vu feeling was coming from.",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161906_008": "Belle, you were the one who gave me the idea. On the ship, you said \"déjà vu is a signal from our subconscious, don't ignore that feeling\"... so I started thinking carefully about where this deja vu feeling was coming from.",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161906_009": "Figuring out the holographic projector part was easy, the real challenge was finding out how they made it invisible... until I realized we've seen something like this before. That's where the deja vu came from.",

  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161906_046": "Well, I can't sit back and do nothing! Sweet Pea's been under a lot of stress lately, and both Anton and Ben could really use this break. No way I'm letting their precious time off get ruined like this!",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161907_007": "One step away from taking over the resort, but right when we hit rock bottom, we managed to bounce back. Of course he's doing everything he can to interfere.",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161908_009": "Ehn-neh! Enn-nhe-nuh! (Hiring thugs to fake hauntings, how awful! Just spill the beans about Three Gates Corp., honestly, and maybe we'll go easy on you! You better think this through!)",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161908_011": "Hey! Listen, we hit the resort simply because you people ticked us off, so we're here to mess with the place. I planned it, they carried it out. That's all there is to it.",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161908_019": "It's okay, Alice. I was just feeling them out. Judging by their attitude, I'd say Willis has already paid them a pretty hefty hush fee. No point wasting time on them.",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161908_031": "Hold on, let me pull it up... Look! Since the hauntings were just spooky but didn't cause any real harm to people, quite a few paranormal enthusiasts are getting super interested in the place.",

Its tiny body hauls several projectors, installing them at various corners of the street, adjusting the settings to invisible mode, and finally leaves with a satisfied look...\n...Instead of handing over the projectors to Public Security last night, Empy reinstalled them throughout the resort... Is this... the truth behind what's happening today?",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161911_009": "Empy has always cared deeply about the resort. There's no way it would do something like this without a reason! There must be something else behind this. We need to find it and figure out the truth.",
  "Activity_GalGame_EndlessSummer_10161913_018": "Haha... And here I thought you had something important to say. How ridiculous! In a lawful society, you can't just throw around accusations without evidence... especially when you're accusing Three Gates Corp.",

  "CardDesc_30034": "A monster forged from Miasma and the memories of a mystic — every painful, haunting moment now sealed within this chaotic form.\nIt's nothing but an imitation in the end, never brave enough to rise up, never decisive enough to disappear without a trace. Yet for its creator, this was sufficient — as a mere pawn, those memories steeped in agony served as potent fuel, enough to turn the Hollow upside down and expose all secrets to the world.\nThus, driven by memories not its own, the Miasma that birthed it made it restless, the approaching Ethereals filled it with rage, and even while prowling its own territory, it remained forever uneasy.\nOnly once, when it chased a human to the edge of the Hollow and saw the fear on their face, was its hunting instinct unexpectedly overridden by a strange impulse. It came to an involuntary stop. And when that unlucky figure vanished from view, it felt something new: an emotion startlingly close to satisfaction.\nBut that sense of satisfaction didn't last. A group of humans in black armor began intruding into its territory again and again, unfazed by any threat. Agitation and exhaustion slowly wore it down — until all it wanted was for everything that moved to disappear. Disappear! DISAPPEAR!!!\n...\n\"...Let's... settle... this...\nStrange, what was that voice?\n\"It's deeply connected... The one who tied the knot must be the one to untie it!\"\nMemories long smothered by madness stirred back to life. Yes... yes! That was the sound — the one that had echoed endlessly in its mind. Though instinct screamed for it to attack, its body hesitated. Its gaze followed the glint of silver hair, so much like its own, desperate to see if the voice belonged to the figure that kept resurfacing in its memory.\nDistracted, it took a direct hit to its core from behind, the excruciating pain nearly breaking it. Yet it still heard that faint whisper:\n\"I'm sorry, I must do this...\"\nThough the words made no sense to it, that near-satisfying emotion returned. It became aware that something genuinely frightening now had it in its grip. It might die because of it... but it had no intention of fleeing.\nIn the end, its strength was completely spent. But in that final moment, it could finally see her clearly. She wasn't quite the same as in its memories, and that fleeting realization brought a trace of loneliness. But even so, it liked her current self more than the heart-shattering screams of the past.\n\n\"The 'Miasmic Fiend'... Hmm, though Ferox's subordinates named it first, this creature's ghostly and vicious nature certainly lives up to the name. We plan to register it as such — what does you think, Yixuan Shifu?\"\n\"Have you heard the ancient saying? 'A name makes the truth no less unfathomable.' A name is just a name — whatever rolls off the tongue will do.\"",
  "CardDesc_30035": "Its peculiar energy fluctuations reveal its identity — an Exaltist creation, the source of nightmares.\nA fearsome hunter, it creeps up on its prey without a sound — yet at times, it's like a restless child playing hide-and-seek, unable to hold back a mischievous giggle. Perhaps the Miasma that birthed it carries too many echoes of lost souls, making it erratic and indecisive.\n\"If play is a privilege of the intelligent, then what it imitates is nothing more than a broken, mindless parody — there's no applause, only bloodshed.\"",

The second added two Ether-Anomaly-tuned components. The third attempted a rewiring of the internals, but caused a short circuit that burned a hole in her skirt. Manato helped with the fourth, repairing the heat conduction module damaged in the short circuit, though the meal she treated him to afterward cost enough to buy three new ones.

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370201_25": "Alice's little ears are always twitching - you wondered what kind of mood makes them do that? As this thought crossed your mind, your hand unconsciously reached for those bunny ears...\n\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!\"",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370201_26": "They say rabbit Thiren tails look short but are actually quite long... Just how long could they be? As soon as that thought crossed your mind, your hand had already instinctively grabbed the tip of the tail, feeling its floofy, warm softness...\n\"EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!!!!!!!!!\"",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370202_01": "Sometimes when I look up at the sky, I can always find these beautiful symmetrical compositions. Let's watch together next time! But you have to promise me... no more scaring me! Otherwise...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370202_02": "——Don't underestimate a rabbit Thiren's bite!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_01": "I've got the full scoop on that antique bottle! So what's the deal with these candles - they got some story behind them too?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_02": "Of course! Every rare item we sell at Mystic Wares has its own fascinating tale - and it's these stories that make them even more valuable~",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_03": "About these candles... Legend has it that a Hollow Raider once met a talking Ethereal in the Hollow. He thought the Ethereal was going to devour him, so he desperately begged for mercy... and the Ethereal let him off the hook.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_04": "An Ethereal that can talk? Even among the Corrupted, such individuals are extremely rare... Could an Ethereal like that really exist?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_05": "Pay attention to the story, star student! The Ethereal spoke up and said it had decided to spare the Hollow Raider's life, and teach him how to dodge Ethereal attacks—",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_06": "It's an incantation: \"Wadanneneda Newadada Enda\"! Just chant it at an Ethereal and it'll go away on its own — but it only works on upright Ethereals, never try it on upside-down ones.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_07": "Is there really such a magical spell? That'd mean we wouldn't have to fear the Ethereal anymore! By the way, where's the candle in this story?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_08": "...Oh right, the candle shows up much later... hmm...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_09": "...So here's what happened: that Hollow Raider couldn't resist turning upside down, and cast a spell on the inverted Ethereal. That's why this talking Ethereal came to take his life, giving him this candle, saying he'd spare his life if the flame doesn't go out...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_10": "Desperate for a flame refill, a Hollow Raider hit up the Cinder Lake in the Outer Ring, only to get dragged to the bottom by a bike-riding high-level Corrupted – and that's how those candles ended up flooding the market–",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_11": "Things are escalating way too fast!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_12": "I feel like I've heard a similar story somewhere before...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_13": "Haha, looks like not just Alice, but Wise is totally captivated too–",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_14": "Hey Wise, you're here to hang at Yuzuha's too? She's been telling me the stories behind all her merchandise - each one's more wild than the last. It's super interesting!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_15": "Yuzuha, tell me about this perfectly symmetrical necklace! It's so beautiful, I'm curious about the story behind it...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_16": "No problem– This bee-shaped necklace was handcrafted by a female Ether scholar using materials like Porcelume found in the Hollow.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_17": "This female scholar's favorite shape is the hexagon found in honeycombs, which is why she specifically crafted the necklace in this style. Besides that, she always uses symmetrically patterned items throughout her daily life.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_18": "Wow, didn't expect to find such a cultured scholar... I'd love to meet them someday! But hey, why did her necklace end up at Mystic Wares?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_19": "About that answer, Wise knows all about it~ Since I've already told him this story before!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_20": "Yuzuha shot me a playful glance. I had no recollection of her ever telling such a story - she probably made it up on the spot... Was this turning into some kind of story-telling relay?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_21": "She encountered a talking Ethereal",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_22": "She wants to pass the necklace on to someone who loves symmetry",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_23": "She's created another perfectly symmetrical accessory",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_24": "That's right! She met that talking Ethereal we mentioned earlier, and decided to switch from studying Ether to researching Ethereals instead! So naturally there was no need to keep this necklace that symbolized her Ether career–",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_25": "She found Mystic Wares, and naturally we took in this necklace, to seek its next suitable owner~",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_26": "That's such a shame... But do talking Ethereals really exist? If they don't, then is this whole story even real or fake...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_27": "Miss, if you keep getting hung up on the details, we'll never get through the story...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_28": "Yuzuha, I've made up my mind... I want to buy that necklace with the story of the female scholar you told me about! How much is it? I want to keep it by my bedside to inspire me every day to never stop improving!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_29": "No need to spend money, little bunny– If you like it, just take it! Consider it a gift from both Wise and me–",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_30": "Yuzuha playfully winked and silently mouthed four words—\"It's her birthday.\" Ah, I see... How thoughtful of Yuzuha.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_31": "Hope you like it, Alice",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_32": "Hmm... I absolutely love it! Yuzuha, Wise, thank you both! If possible, I'd love to hear more stories about the other items in the display window next time!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_33": "Mmm... I absolutely love it! Yuzuha, Belle, thank you both! If possible, I'd love to hear more stories about the other items in the display window next time!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_34": "No need to pay, little bunny– just take it if you like it! Consider it a gift from Belle and me–",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_35": "That's right! She's already reached the pinnacle of her career, so she wants to gradually step back from academia and return to her own life. And this necklace represents the hope she has for the next generation.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_36": "She found Mystic Wares, hoping we could pass the necklace to the next talented scholar who shares her love for symmetry. We've been searching until today.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_37": "What an amazing story! I hope that one day, I can be as accomplished as that scholar... When that time comes, I'll definitely pass my own belt down to the next promising talent!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_38": "That's right! She wasn't satisfied with just axial symmetry - she kept chasing after perfect symmetry until she created an accessory that was symmetrical from every possible angle. The original piece? She handed that over to us.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_39": "According to her, she hopes this necklace will inspire every customer who visits the store to strive for excellence and never stop pursuing beauty... so I put it on display in the window!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_40": "Oh my god, a perfectly symmetrical ornament, I wonder what that's like... I'd love to ask that scholar about it in person!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_41": "As for that answer, Belle knows~ Because I've already told her this story before!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_42": "Hey Belle, you're here to hang at Yuzuha's too! She's been telling me the stories behind all her merchandise - each one's a wild ride, it's so fascinating!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_43": "Haha, looks like not just Alice, but Belle is totally captivated too–",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370301_Name_01": "Ukinami Yuzuha",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370302_01": "By the way, Yuzuha... what was that female scholar's name? I'd like to look up some info about her when I get home.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370302_02": "Huh? What are you saying? Kama kept interrupting just now, I couldn't hear clearly–",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370302_Name_01": "Ukinami Yuzuha",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_01": "This cursed videotape will be my trial... As a brave descendant of the Thymefield family, I must have the courage to face it head-on!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_02": "What's up with this videotape?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_03": "Wise, what a coincidence! Actually, I saw this post on Spook Shack's Inter-Knot forum about a cursed videotape - everyone who's watched it has been struck with misfortune...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_04": "...like never getting my bangs even when I trim them, my tail getting all frizzy every time it rains, or always losing at Spooky Cards with my friends.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_05": "What an awkwardly unfortunate event...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_06": "Doesn't feel like a particularly strong curse...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_07": "No, don't underestimate it! They say when you get to the middle-end part of the videotape, a dried-up well appears on screen, and a ghost Bangboo crawls out of it, right through the screen...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_08": "...No, I can't say any more... If that scene actually happened, it would be absolutely terrifying!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_09": "You look pretty scared...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_10": "How about we watch this videotape together?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_11": "...Really? Doesn't that creep you out?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_12": "I'm not so scared when I'm with you",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_13": "I don't think it's that scary",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_14": "Let's scream together at the scary parts",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_15": "O-oh, really... I thought my startled scream would've only made you more scared...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_16": "Maybe that's what having companions is all about. Just having someone by your side makes the fear feel twice as light.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_17": "Who knew I could actually be useful when it comes to horror stuff...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_18": "So, shall we start watching together now...?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_19": "Alice nervously started playing the haunted videotape she was holding. Just as she'd expected, the content wasn't scary at all - ghost Bangboo crawling out of the well was even kind of cute... but Alice still got startled several times, clutching the hem of her clothes over and over until it was all wrinkled after two hours...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_20": "I-I finished reading...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_21": "How should I put this... It was pretty scary, not gonna lie! But it didn't seem supernatural at all, and nothing weird happened. Looks like that whole \"cursed videotape\" thing might just be a rumor.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_22": "Wise, could you pass me that videotape box? I'll get the footage sorted...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_23": "Hm? The bottom of the back of the box...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_24": "Why does it say \"Custom Human: Alice\"?",

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_26": "Don't tell me you staged this video, Alice",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_27": "So you can watch it with me?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_28": "...",

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_32": "Belle, could you pass me that videotape box over there? I'll get it recorded...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_33": "...Hey, but Wise, aren't you just like me - totally helpless when it comes to horror movies? When did you stop being scared of this stuff...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_34": "In that case, I need you even more... Seeing that you're not scared gives me the courage to be brave too...!",

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_36": "...Oh, I get it! So that's how it works!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_37": "I'm worried that if I scream alone, I'll look like a scaredy-cat and get weird looks from everyone around. But if I hold it in, this fear bottled up inside might feel even worse...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_38": "When two people do it together, all worries just melt away! Now we're partners in sharing the \"horror\"! What an awesome bond...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370401_39": "Belle, what a coincidence! Actually, I saw this post on the Inter-Knot forum at Spook Shack about a cursed videotape - everyone who watches it ends up with terrible luck...",

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_09": "Sorry, Miss Esme used to speak more casually... She didn't look like this before. Ever since I got her that limited edition Magic Sailor Boo skin recently, even her way of talking has changed...",

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_11": "Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm. (Miss Alice gave me such a striking makeover, I simply must carry myself with matching elegance.)",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_12": "Mhm... mhm. (Improper Bangboo language, behavior unbecoming of nobility, and such petty interests - I make sure none of these show in my daily life.)",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_13": "Mmhmm-hmm-hmm. (Therefore, Miss Alice, I will diligently attend the Bangboo flower arrangement class organized by Miss Orchidea that you arranged, and I'll secure the top spot in class. Please let me attend the class.)",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_14": "Miss Esme, you don't have to be so serious about it... *sigh*...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_15": "I never had the courage to revisit Magic Sailor Boo before, since I lost my hairpin with that theme when I was little... But lately I feel more ready to face the past, so I tried upgrading its appearance...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_16": "But I never expected it would put such unexpected pressure on Miss Esme. Wise, do you have any ideas...",

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_21": "Hmm... hmm... (But... is this really okay... what if someone sees a Thymefield noble like Bangboo doing something so unbecoming of their status in such a conspicuous way...)",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370501_22": "Wise is right. Miss Esme, don't put too much pressure on yourself! Being brave and free - that's what a Thymefield Bangboo should be like.",

  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_19": "I didn't see... anything... except for a pair of eyes - one red, one yellow...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_20": "Isn't that just your own reflection...?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_21": "Hmm... I can't see anything inside the room at all. Instead, the window glass has turned into a mirror, and in my moment of intense focus, I caught a glimpse of my heterochromatic eyes...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_22": "Sorry... getting scared by my own heterochromia, pretty lame of me, huh?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_23": "I don't think I'm lame at all",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_24": "Does Alice not like her own eyes?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_25": "I've never been comfortable with my eyes since I was little... One red and one yellow, totally mismatched. I think they look awful.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_26": "That's why I rarely stare into my own eyes when I look in the mirror. It makes me really uncomfortable.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_27": "Just now, seeing my eyes reflected in the glass hit me hard. Every time, it reminds me... I'm not perfect, and I'll never be perfect again.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_28": "I really like your eyes",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_29": "Nobody has to be perfect",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_30": "...Really?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_31": "Your eyes are special",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_32": "Your eyes are crystal clear",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_33": "Looking into your eyes always gives me strength",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_34": "From your tone... you're not just saying that to spare my feelings.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_35": "Thank you... for liking my eyes. After hearing what you said, I'm starting to... starting to feel that these eyes aren't so bad after all.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_36": "Even though we haven't made much progress investigating the ghost stories, my mood feels way better. All thanks to you!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_37": "Wise, if we get the chance in the future... I want you to look into my eyes more often. Step by step, I want to fall more in love with these eyes - these eyes that you admire.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_38": "Belle, if we get the chance... I want you to look into my eyes more. Step by step, I want to fall more in love with these eyes - these eyes that you admire.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_39": "But I always demand perfect symmetry from external things... so I need to be symmetrical too, otherwise I'd be a hypocrite...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_40": "No way!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_41": "Your eyes are an extension of all things beautiful",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_42": "Is that so... Maybe I've been overthinking things too much. My two different eye colors, inherited from my father and mother...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_43": "You're right, they're an extension of who I am. Looking at it that way, I've grown to love my eyes even more.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370601_44": "Belle, thank goodness I found you here! Listen... would you come with me to the rooftop of this building?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370602_01": "Come to think of it, why... can I see my eyes reflected so clearly in the window? I heard these aren't even one-way mirrors...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370602_02": "...better not think too much about it...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_01": "Wise, even though we're in the Outer Ring... but...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_02": "What's wrong?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_03": "You seem a bit tense?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_04": "...I was just thinking, I barely know any of Lucy's friends from the Outer Ring, and now suddenly having to meet them... What if they don't like me?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_05": "I've never had many friends growing up, let alone hanging with biker gangs. They'd probably just see me as some sheltered flower...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_06": "You're worrying too much!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_07": "They're all good people!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_08": "R-really...? If I mess up somewhere, could you help smooth things over for me?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_09": "You bet!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_10": "Phew... Let's head out! I've already figured out how I'm gonna greet them!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370701_11": "Belle, even though we're in the Outer Ring... but...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_01": "After arriving at the meeting spot I'd arranged with Lucy, we waited for a short while before the Sons of Calydon quickly showed up.\nAlice instinctively grabbed the hem of my clothes, then quickly let go, fidgeting as she pressed her index fingers together...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_02": "Alice, you're right on time! Welcome to the Outer Ring. Let me introduce you to these idiots - they're our Sons of Calydon members.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_03": "Hey Lucy, didn't we agree not to call us out like that in front of people we just met! We ain't as smart as you, but at least let us save some face!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_04": "Caesar and Lucy are at it again with their squabblin'... Let's pay them no mind. Welcome, youngun'~ Still hittin' the books? Same age as Lucy? Ya seem more well-developed than her~",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_05": "Piper, you're talking like such an old man! When meeting new friends, you gotta speak the Nitro-Fuel way! What'll it be? Want a glass? A whole barrel? Or... wanna pet Meow's tail?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_06": "Why am I suddenly being dragged into this— Hey, stop taking advantage of the chaos to touch my tail! Listen to my advice: stay away from these people, they'll definitely try to get their hands on your bunny ears and tail sooner or later!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_07": "...You guys are messing around too much, you're scaring poor Miss Alice. Let's give her a chance to speak and introduce herself.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_08": "...I-I-I'm Alice, Alice Thymefield, Lucy's friend from her old school. N-n-nice to m-meet you...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_09": "Alice, no need to be nervous",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_10": "This kind of fooling around is just their daily routine",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_11": "Yes, Alice, if you get nervous around these idiots, you'll become an idiot too. Just be yourself, we'll all be friends soon enough.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_12": "Lucy's right! Alice, welcome to the Outer Ring - make yourself at home here, no need to be formal with us!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_13": "...Th-thank you everyone! Sorry, I got a bit carried away earlier... Nice to meet you all! Oh right... Here's a small token of my appreciation!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_14": "Alice rummaged through her belongings and handed out various items one by one to the Sons of Calydon.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_15": "Lucy mentioned all of you before, and your interests too... Miss Caesar, Lucy said you like reading manga, so here's a three-year Platinum membership card for the Lumina Square bookstore. Please accept it.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_16": "Miss Piper, I heard you've got a sweet ride called Steeltusk. I've ordered a complete set of the latest modding tools and parts for it - they should arrive in a day or two.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_17": "Miss Burnice, Lucy says you're a Nitro-Fuel master, so I thought you might like this... Three-year-old Nitro-Fuel raw materials that I got from a manufacturer I know.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_18": "Miss Pulchra, here's a three-year VIP membership card for Bevers Beauty Salon; Mr. Lighter, I've bought every style of sunglasses currently available in New Eridu, they'll be arriving in the next couple of days...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_19": "...And that's about it, hope you all like it!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_20": "...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_21": "...I nominate Alice as the new second-in-command of the Sons of Calydon. Who's in favor, who's against?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_22": "Huh, w-what?!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_23": "Burnice, what do you mean?! Deputy is MY position! You let yourself get bought off with these little favors?! Someone back me up here... wait, Alice, is that... toner in your hand?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_24": "L-Lucy, you were complaining before about how everyone keeps using your toner and it runs out so quickly... so I bought all of Carlishe's products from the past few years, thinking I'd give them to you...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_25": "Oh, this is just one bottle I've got here - Mr. Arnold's keeping the rest in my car. I'll hand them over to you in a bit!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_26": "...Fine, I guess I can let her have this spot for a couple of days. Alice, from today on, you're part of the Sons of Calydon!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_27": " tags. I can help validate and check translations, but I need both the source text and a proposed translation to review. Could you please provide the text you'd like me to check?\n\nFor the task shown above, I can confirm that the provided translation:\n<translated_text>*cough* Well, if ya put it that way! If we could get a few more platinum membership cards... I reckon we could take it a step further, let Alice be boss for a week - y'know, just to get a taste of Outer Ring life...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_28": "Boss Alice, ever since you hooked me up with three years' worth of Nitro-Fuel ingredients, I knew right then - I'm dedicating my life to you! I'll walk through fire and storm, whatever it takes!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_29": "N-no, that's not it! I just wanted to give everyone a little welcome gift... Besides, I don't even know how to ride a motorcycle!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_30": "Boss says so, Boss ain't fond of motorcycles! Boss, this here person could be your personal driver... Steeltusk's passenger seat is mighty comfy!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_31": "Guys, come on... I'm not cut out for the biker gang life!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_32": "Hey boss, you sure about this? Once you learn how to ride, you can cruise freely around the Outer Ring. That feeling of total freedom? It's pretty sweet, trust me.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_33": "And you can be like me, wear whatever you want without caring what those nobles think, boss. A wild style might actually suit you pretty well!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_34": "...Really? No, no, that's not what I meant! I'm just curious about your lives, that's all! Hey Wise, say something too! Being a biker gang leader and all, it's totally...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_35": "Alice shot me a pleading look - seems like the Sons of Calydon might've taken their teasing a bit too far... But seeing her so flustered like this is just... what should I do?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_36": "She's more at home with ghost stories than motorcycles",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_37": "Want to see Alice in biker gear",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_38": "You can own your very own symmetrical motorcycle!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_39": "Yeah, that's it! Not that there's anything wrong with biker gangs... but I guess I've gotten used to investigating spooky rumors with Yuzuha and Manato as our daily thing.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_40": "So sorry, but I can't join you guys...!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_41": "Hmph, a straight-up rejection, huh... Looks like you've found yourself some decent companions. Everyone, stop teasing Alice and give her and Proxy a proper welcome!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_42": "Welcomed by the Sons of Calydon, I enjoyed a hearty meal with Alice at Cheesetopia, listening to their stories about life in the Outer Ring. Alice listened intently, completely absorbed, as if painting a picture in her mind of herself as a little biker...\nThough for now, it's probably best to keep that as just a fantasy.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_43": "Lucy and the others have left... Wise, let's head home too. Their enthusiasm was... a bit too much to handle, don't you think?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_44": "Don't go throwing your money around next time",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_45": "I just wanted to get closer quickly... But I get it now, won't do that again. Thanks for having my back and getting me out of that situation.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_46": "How should I put this... Everyone's great and all, but I feel more comfortable hanging out with you since you're not so... intense.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_47": "Lucy and the others have left... Belle, let's head home too. Their enthusiasm is... a bit too much to handle, don't you think?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_48": "Hold up, what nonsense are you talking about! Didn't I say I can't be part of the Biker Gangs!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_49": "Wearing a helmet and shades, rocking shorts and a bat...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_50": "Stop imagining things!!! It might seem cool, but I'm dying of embarrassment!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_51": "Alright, Proxy and everyone else, while teasing Alice is fun... we should stop now. She's got companions over at the Spook Shack. Let's give Alice and Proxy a proper welcome!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_52": "Eh... there's a perk like that too?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_53": "Alice's heart is racing! Come on, become the new boss of the Sons of Calydon!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_54": "No no no no no, that's not what I meant! I just got a little excited for a moment, I'm really not cut out for riding motorcycles!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_55": "Enough, Burnice and Proxy, stop teasing Alice... Her heart's over at the Spook Shack. Let's give Alice and Proxy a proper welcome instead!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_56": "...Really? No, no, that's not what I meant - I'm just curious about your lives! Belle, say something too! Being the leader of a biker gang is totally...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370702_Name_01": "The Sons of Calydon",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_01": "Wise, you made it! Hope you didn't run into anyone on your way here...?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_02": "Belle, you're here! Hope you didn't run into anyone on your way...?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_03": "Not at all.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_04": "Dodged everyone!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_05": "Hmm, that's good... After all, the Lighthouse is a restricted area now. If Therese or anyone else finds out, we'll definitely get chewed out...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_06": "I don't think the resort people would do that",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_07": "Therese really likes you, no way",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_08": "Just think about it... if everyone gets a free pass, what's the point of being the bad student anymore!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370801_09": "Anyway, let's sneak over there... we gotta be super stealthy about this!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_01": "With Alice, we snuck through the wire fence and made our way along the coastal path until we reached the lighthouse. Everything went so smoothly it was almost nerve-wracking...\nThe lighthouse was a bit chilly at night and eerily quiet, with waves crashing in the distance...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_02": "Success... We made it to the lighthouse without anyone spotting us!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_03": "Feeling relaxed?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_04": "It's such a strange feeling... The beach, sea breeze, and ocean surface are exactly the same as before, nothing's changed, yet it feels like I'm on some deserted island... What about you?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_05": "Feels like being exiled",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_06": "Feels like I'm on top of the world",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_07": "Feels like we're the only ones left in the world",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_08": "Pfft... Exile? Were our misdeeds really that over-the-top?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_09": "But it does feel kinda refreshing to break free from the world's constraints, even if there's this nagging unease...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_10": "Exile really is the perfect way to describe it!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_11": "So much has happened lately... The old me would never have imagined breaking the rules and climbing up the lighthouse.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_12": "To be honest... I just wanted to try being a bad student again after so long... but you know what? Doing this every now and then feels pretty good!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_13": "You're already the poster child for bad students!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_14": "Am I the one who corrupted you...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_15": "Yeah... Yuzuha would be shocked if she knew! The little bunny she talks about can now see views from the lighthouse that she's never reached herself.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_16": "Look! From up here at the lighthouse, the resort looks like a perfect little sandbox! If I hadn't come up here for this view, I might never have known what the whole resort actually looks like...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_17": "If I hadn't mustered up the courage to try, I would've never seen some of these amazing sights. I guess that's the biggest takeaway from our little bad student adventure!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_18": "The act of summarizing the event",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_19": "A good student by nature",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_20": "Pfft... hahaha! You're right, I always subconsciously analyze the process of everything - that's way too by-the-book to be something a bad student would do!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_21": "In that case... let's do something more \"delinquent-like\" that won't make it into the event report.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_22": "Wise, the sea breeze is a bit chilly at this hour... C-come closer to me...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_23": "Got a bit closer to Alice. Who knew a Thiren's heartbeat could be so intense... Just from our shoulders touching, I could feel it crystal clear.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_24": "Leaning against the railing at the lighthouse, they chatted through the night until daybreak crept across the horizon. Together, they snuck down from the lighthouse and made their way back to the resort...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_25": "Belle, the sea breeze is a bit chilly at this hour... c-come closer to me...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_26": "You think so? Then you'll have to take responsibility... Just kidding. I think it's more that my state of mind has changed...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_27": "Hahaha... Letting two troublemakers rule the world? That would throw all of New Eridu into total chaos!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_28": "Though \"ruling\" might be a bit inaccurate, since we're literally the only ones left here... It feels more like we've got exclusive rights to all the views New Eridu has to offer.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_29": "Now then, it's time to take in all these beautiful sights~",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_30": "What was that feeling... it's so weird.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_31": "...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_32": "Just thinking about how we're the only two left in the world fills me with this inexplicable sense of dread and sadness.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_33": "But when I think about you being here... it doesn't feel so bad anymore. You know that feeling, right?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_34": "If you feel the same way... then we're on the same wavelength.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370802_35": "Let's hold onto this uneasy yet grateful feeling... and feel the sea breeze together.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370901_01": "Wise, what kind of stuff are you looking to buy lately?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370901_02": "Clothes, electronics, snacks...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370901_03": "Hmm, just as I thought! I had Mr. Arnold drive us here today, so no need to worry about carrying the shopping bags - he'll take care of moving everything for us. Feel free to shop to your heart's content!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370901_04": "Alright, let's head out now!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370901_05": "Belle, what kind of stuff are you looking to buy lately?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_01": "We're here... Let's go in and look around in a moment. But before that, I have a few questions about your tastes and preferences...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_02": "Wise, what's your favorite style of clothing?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_03": "Casual Style",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_04": "Athletic Style",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_05": "Preppy Style",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_06": "Hmm... so what gadgets have you been eyeing lately?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_07": "New phone!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_08": "New camera!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_09": "New game console!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_10": "I see... So what about snacks? What's your go-to munchies?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_11": "Potato Chips",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_12": "Cake",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_13": "Cookie",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_14": "Oh, I get it now! Should we focus on checking out those types of stores then?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_15": "I went to Lumina Galleria with Alice, browsing through stores she was interested in and the ones we'd just talked about.\nShe bought quite a lot of stuff, but on my end, some clothes and electronics I liked were pretty pricey. Even though I could afford them, Belle would definitely give me an earful back home - gotta be more careful with money after all...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_16": "After finishing their shopping and leaving the mall, Alice handed her purchases to Mr. Arnold. She seemed to have something else to say...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_17": "Wise, you seem pretty frugal with your spending... Don't Proxies make decent money though?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_18": "That money was confiscated earlier...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_19": "And there's another power hog at home...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_20": "{M#Belle}{F#Brother} told me to be careful with spending",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_21": "Just as I thought... Earlier at the mall, I noticed you were interested in a lot of things, but your gaze would quickly shift away after lingering for just a moment - trying to hold back your shopping urges...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_22": "Alice's got a sharp eye for detail!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_23": "I know, because I've been watching you too",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_24": "N-no, it's nothing special... We Thiren just have good eyesight, so I happened to notice...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_25": "...Well, actually, I was kinda worried about you and stuff, so I kept an eye on you...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_26": "Anyway... I think being overly frugal affects your quality of life, so I took note of all the items you were eyeing earlier and had Mr. Arnold buy them all. They'll be delivered to your place soon.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_27": "Huh? Whaaaat?!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_28": "Wait, am I dreaming right now?!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_29": "Why would I think this is a dream... You're such an important friend to me, of course I'll help out with something this small!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_30": "The price I just glanced at...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_31": "Adding it all up, it's way more than just a simple task now...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_32": "Don't worry about it, the Thymefield family can totally afford these expenses. So please stop being so frugal... I'd be really upset if it affected your life and health!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_33": "Whether it's you or Belle, if anything like this happens again in the future, please make sure to tell me. I rarely spend money on myself, but when it comes to helping friends, spending becomes so much more meaningful!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_34": "Alice, you're gonna spoil me rotten...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_35": "R-really? I trust you're not the type to just slack off at home all day just 'cause you've got friends helping you out... right?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_36": "Of course I'm not!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_37": "(Looks away)",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_38": "Yeah, I believe in you!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_39": "*sigh* I can't believe you'd do this... You're really something else. But don't worry, I've still got your back...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_40": "Hi there! Whether it's you or Wise, please make sure to let me know if something like this happens again. I rarely spend money on myself - spending only becomes meaningful when I'm helping out friends!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_41": "Whaaaat?! You knew I was sneaking peeks at you this whole time??",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_42": "Ahhh... this is so embarrassing! You could've told me when you noticed - I thought I wouldn't get caught...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_43": "Belle, you seem pretty frugal with your spending... Don't you make good money as a Proxy?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_44": "I went to Lumina Galleria with Alice, browsing through stores that caught her interest and checking out the ones we'd just talked about.\nShe ended up buying quite a lot, but looking at my side of things, some of the clothes and electronics I liked were pretty pricey. Even though I could afford them, my brother would definitely give me an earful if I bought them - gotta be more careful with money after all...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330370902_45": "Belle, what's your favorite style of clothing?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371001_01": "According to Yuzuha, the flea market stalls in Failume Heights aren't really clustered together, and their operating hours are pretty irregular...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371001_02": "After all, we've still got the Porcelume Market",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371001_03": "That's just how street vendors roll - always on the move",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371001_04": "Is that so... It's hard for me to imagine what that sight would be like until I see it with my own eyes...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371001_05": "Alright, let's head out! Time to check out this so-called flea market in person!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_01": "According to Yuzuha, the flea market stall should be opening here today... Huh, there's really just one stall or something...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_02": "Hey miss, don't look down on me like that! So what if I'm running this by myself? Ever heard the saying 'small but mighty'? My stall's got everything you could want!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_03": "Let's check out the goods",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_04": "Here ya go, all laid out in front of ya! Fair prices for everyone, take your time and browse!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_05": "Let me see... what's the story behind this guitar?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_06": "You've got a great eye! This guitar was unearthed from the ruins of Aerospace City—and after all these years, it can still play tunes without going out of tune at all!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_07": "No cap, this guitar must've belonged to some A-list celebrity back when Aerospace City wasn't abandoned! How else could it be such high quality?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_08": "I see. About the price... How much does it cost? Would 5 million Denny be enough?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_09": "..........Five million?! Miss, I'm not running some heartless scam joint here - what makes you think I'd charge that much? That's hitting below the belt, yo!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_10": "I'm not asking for much, just this amount—50,000. 50,000 Denny, and this guitar is yours. You can take it home and play all night long, get a taste of what kind of divine instruments the musicians in Aerospace City are using.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_11": "Fifty grand is way too low... *ahem* No, I didn't say anything! Actually, fifty grand seems too high - how about forty-nine thousand?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_12": "...A thousand off? Deal, it's yours.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_13": "Alice, that's not how you haggle",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_14": "Can't let them get away with such an easy advantage",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_15": "...Oh, really? Let me think... *ahem* That price from before was way too high! I'd say 1000 Denny should be about right.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_16": "...Miss, are you kidding me? Selling this guitar for 1000 Denny? I might as well keep it for myself! At 1000 Denny I'm barely breaking even - can't even buy a bowl of ramen with that!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_17": "Look, you should probably check out something else! The way you're trying to haggle so hard shows you're not really feeling this guitar anyway.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_18": "Hmm... So what's the deal with that fan? How much is it? The design looks so unique...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_19": "Huh? Why are you interested in that... This fan's nothing special, just a cheap one I brought from home 'cause it gets too stuffy at my stall. Don't all Waifei Peninsula residents have one of these at home anyway?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_20": "O-oh really... What about that symmetrical porcelain? That must be merchandise, right?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_21": "Got your eye on this one? This baby's got quite a story! It was smuggled out of Aerospace City - while it's made of regular porcelain, it's got several pieces of Porcelume embedded inside, making it super drop-resistant!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_22": "More importantly, it was apparently found inside some important facility in Aerospace City. In other words, as an artifact, it's worth a fortune! You've got your eye on quite a treasure there!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_23": "I see... The interior is definitely inlaid with Porcelume, though not a whole lot of it...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_24": "10 million Denny, what do you say?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_25": "W-w-w-what, ten million?!?! Deal, whatever you say! Let's get this trade going—",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_26": "Alice, calm down! If it's really that valuable...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_27": "Are they just gonna put it up at the flea market like that?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_28": "Tch, what do you know! This is a genuine antique, why wouldn't it be worth this much?! I don't have my own shop, so of course I gotta sell on the street!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_29": "Wise, I understand your concerns... What he said was definitely exaggerated. This porcelain, from what we can see now, was probably just ordinary household decoration from a regular resident's home, nothing particularly noble, but it's still a cultural relic nonetheless.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_30": "Since it's a relic related to Porcelume, bringing it back to our research institute would definitely have scientific value. Plus, 10 million Denny seems like a pretty reasonable price...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_31": "Yeah, that's all true, but...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_32": "Ten million? That's straight-up highway robbery!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_33": "Alice, having had Mr. Arnold the butler manage all household finances, clearly had no concept of money... I quietly explained to her that ten million was no small sum.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_34": "Eh... really? I didn't think it was that much... could buy like 10 sets of the latest gadgets or something...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_35": "So... we can only offer that number you just mentioned?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_36": "...So, are you done discussing? Are you gonna buy it or not?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_37": "Yeah, we'll buy it... but we can only offer 100,000 Denny.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_38": "If you'd said 100k from the start, I would've sold it. But now you're going from 10 mil down to 100k? That price drop... yeah, no deal!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_39": "...But if you'd stop pulling that overpriced nonsense all the time, I might be down to check out some other stuff.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_40": "Buy an old fan to keep cool",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_41": "Buy matching accessories",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_42": "Buy an old radio",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_43": "Wise, how did you know I was interested in this fan... I've never seen this style before, and its structure is so symmetrical - I've been wanting to take a good look at it!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_44": "Because I remember what you just said",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_45": "You wanna buy this busted fan? Are you serious? And in this stuffy heat, you want me to just sit here dripping with sweat without a fan...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_46": "We'll offer a higher price",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_47": "...Fine, fine, it's yours now. It was the oldest model anyway, perfect time to get a new one...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_48": "Awesome... Thanks, Wise! I'll take it home and treasure it!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_49": "Picked up some stuff with Alice, then left the flea market together...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_49_1": "*sigh*... That left me wanting more.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_50": "So, how's your first time at the flea market?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_51": "How should I put this... Even though it was a bit embarrassing, I'm glad you were there. I feel like I've never experienced anything quite like this before...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_52": "Next time, let's check out a bigger market or something like that! Sure, they might just be small trinkets, but when they hold memories with you... each item takes on its own special flavor.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_53": "Awesome... Thanks, Belle! I'll take it home and treasure it!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_54": "Belle, how did you know I was interested in this fan... I've never seen this style before, and its structure is so symmetrical. I've been wanting to get a good look at it since earlier!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_55": "Oh my gosh, I wanted this the moment I laid eyes on it! Can I really have it?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_56": "It may be cheap stuff...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_57": "But it'd be great if you like it",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_58": "Hmm... I really like it, thank you!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_59": "A radio...? What can I do with this?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_60": "Use it to tune in to the Ghost Story Radio",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_61": "It's gonna be lit",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_62": "Oh, so that's how it is...! Should we go back and give it a listen? Just talking about it is getting me hyped!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_63": "Belle, I understand your concerns... What he said was definitely exaggerated. This porcelain piece, from today's perspective, seems to be just ordinary household decor from a regular resident's home, nothing particularly noble, but it is still a cultural relic.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371002_Name_01": "Street Vendor",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371101_01": "Wise, about \"The Port Peak\"...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371101_02": "Got it right here",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371101_03": "Eek!! C-could you keep that a bit further away? Just looking at the cover is giving me the creeps...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371101_04": "But didn't you want to borrow it to read?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371101_05": "Y-yeah... that's right. About that...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371101_06": "Belle, about The Port Peak...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371102_01": "This is my first time watching a horror movie all the way through... Zhe, thanks to you keeping me desensitized with your funny jokes!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371102_02": "Let's watch horror movies together again sometime, okay? If I watch enough of them... I think I'll stop being scared!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371102_03": "This is the first time I've ever watched a horror movie all the way through... Belle, thanks for helping me get desensitized with your hilarious jokes!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_01": "Miss, I'm sorry... I'm here to pay back the money today...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_02": "Pay you back? Don't think I know you...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_03": "Pay me back?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_04": "Doesn't Alice know her?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_05": "Belle, it's you! Um... I was just heading to Mystic Wares to find Yuzuha when this lady suddenly stopped me. She said she wanted to pay me back, but I don't think I know her...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_06": "We haven't had any direct contact... but if you remember this Bangboo, you might have some clues about it.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_07": "Bangboo? Well, Bangboo models are pretty much all generic, so I can't really tell them apart...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_08": "Wise, it's you! Um... I was just heading to Mystic Wares to find Yuzuha when this lady suddenly stopped me. She said she wanted to pay me back, but I don't think I know her...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371201_Name_01": "A-Yao",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371202_01": "I'm not as gentle as you say... In my opinion, there's someone else who fits that description better.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371202_02": "She's there with me, doing things I'm too scared to do, and seriously helping me through my troubles. She hates injustice and stands by her beliefs... I heard she's helped lots of people out of tough spots before...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371202_03": "And they'd tell me that I'm not actually a coward, but a brave person...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371202_04": "N-no, stop... I can't say any more!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371202_05": "He's there with me when I'm scared to do things, and seriously helps me through my troubles. He hates injustice and stands by his own beliefs... I heard he's helped a lot of people out of crisis situations before...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_01": "Hmm, let me see... knock three times lightly, five times heavily, and if there's a knock back from the other side of the door, whisper \"I want to go to the other side\"...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_02": "*huff*... *huff*... Alice, stay cool... Here we go!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_03": "Alice? What are you doing?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_04": "Hey, disturbing others isn't cool, you know?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_05": "Eeeeeeeaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_06": "Alice seemed completely oblivious to anyone around her. A simple greeting made her shriek in surprise, then she slumped to the ground and took quite a while to get back up...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_07": "Ugh... Wise, it's you... You scared me to death. I thought a ghost had shown up before I even knocked...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_08": "Don't tell me you're trying to verify urban legends?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_09": "Hmm... so we're not disturbing anyone! I checked it out - this house should be vacant right now!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_10": "A while back, Yuzuha told me that Spook Shack actually has other members, though they're online friends I haven't met yet. She suggested I get to know them first on Knock Knock...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_11": "Then these two online friends who go by \"Strawberry Parfait\" and \"Night Emissary\" sent me a compiled list of New Eridu urban legends to welcome me as a newbie!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_12": "So you want to experience the urban legends on the list?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_13": "Alice is so bold...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_14": "No, it's not that... I just thought it'd be kinda rude to toss aside the urban legend list without even looking at it, especially as a new Spook Shack member! So I picked out a few that caught my eye, you know, to check if they're legit...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_15": "...Wise, since you're here... would you try out these urban legends with me? I'm not too confident about doing it alone...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_16": "Even though I'm not too sure about this...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_17": "But together, we've got this!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_18": "Really? That's awesome!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_19": "Let's start with the first urban legend... the one I just tried to test—\"The Portal That Connects to Another World!\"",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_20": "Legend has it that at midnight, if you come alone to this alley by Lumina Square, tap the shutter door three times softly, five times hard, and then whisper \"I want to go to the other side\"...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_21": "...the door will open, and a hand from another world will reach out and drag you in...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_22": "Is this ghost story legit...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_23": "Well, let's give it a shot...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_24": "Hmm... well then, ready? I'm gonna knock, okay? I'm really gonna do it this time, okay? You'll stay right here with me, right?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_25": "After triple-checking everything, Alice nervously and cautiously knocked on the rolling door according to the urban legend's instructions...\n.........\n...After waiting for more than five minutes on the spot, still nothing happened.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_26": "So this ghost story... was fake after all. Thank goodness, no hands actually reached out from behind the door...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_27": "Awesome!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_28": "That's great.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_29": "*sigh*...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_30": "...Wise, there are still two urban legends to verify. Would you come with me again?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_31": "Huh? There's more?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_32": "Well, I guess it's not impossible...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_33": "Thanks! If I don't verify a few more urban legends, I'm worried I won't have anything to talk about with \"Strawberry Parfait\" and \"Night Messenger\"...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_34": "Let's head to our next stop then—the phone booth on Sixth Street!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_35": "...Belle, there are two more ghost stories to verify. Would you come with me again?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_36": "...Belle, since you're here... would you try out these urban legends with me? I'm not too confident about doing it alone...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371301_37": "Ugh... Belle, it's you... You scared me half to death. I thought I hadn't even knocked yet and a ghost had already shown up...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371302_01": "For the sake of having something to talk about... I've gotta experience these ghost stories firsthand!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371302_02": "Yeah, this is for a friend... definitely not because I'm interested!",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371303_01": "We're here... This is the second haunted spot I picked from the urban legend list - \"The Ghost Girl's Phone Call\", Paranormal Rank A+.",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371303_02": "What's with this paranormal ranking stuff...",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371303_03": "How do we measure paranormal ranks?",
  "PartnerTalk_Chat_PartnerAlice_330371303_04": "The Paranormal Rank is a standard created by Yuzuha to evaluate how likely supernatural stories are to be real. The last story was only B-Rank... but this one's A+ Rank, which means there's a whopping 38% chance it actually happened!",

  "PartnerTalk_GalGame_PartnerAlice_10043602_054": "Honestly, I think Big Guin did all this because it was just scared of losing its owner... Although the way it handled things wasn't right, its heart was in the right place. With a little help, I'm sure it'll do better.",

She currently attends Celestia School for Girls, a subsidiary of High Ambitions Academy, where she's a model student excelling in both academics and conduct. It is predicted that she will one day inherit the family business and become a next-generation Ether scholar of New Eridu.\n\nShe places extreme importance on order and patterns, showing an almost obsessive pursuit of symmetry in particular. This even affects her aesthetic judgment, making symmetry the primary criterion in determining whether something is beautiful or ugly.\n\nFurthermore, she's easily frightened, with practically zero resistance to ghost stories and supernatural tales. Despite this, she seems to show considerable interest in encountering such phenomena. Suggestion: Master can use ghost stories as a topic of conversation with her. No matter how much she initially refuses, it is likely that she will eventually come closer to investigate.",
  "Partner_ProfileDesc_1401_1": "According to my investigations, Alice has been obsessed with symmetry ever since she was young, but after experiencing the loss of her symmetrical hairpin and her father's subsequent death, she subconsciously attributed the tragedy to the loss of a symmetrical object, which intensified her obsession with symmetry.\n\nAs a prestigious family known for their Ether science research, the Thymefield family is currently facing a decline. With Alice's parents passing away early and her grandfather falling ill, and after giving away the family's patents to save a friend, she's determined to start anew and revive the family through her own strength.\n\nDespite her timid nature, once she sets her mind on accomplishing something, she'll pursue it with unwavering determination. Moreover, she values her companions deeply and would never ignore their difficulties... Therefore, Master, I strongly recommend improving relations with Alice and informing her about our current financial struggles with paying the electricity bills.",
  "Partner_ProfileDesc_1411_1": "According to Yuzuha, she's been wandering the Faunus Quarter for as long as she can remember, living as part of a small gang of street kids. She didn't have a name back then. Due to malnutrition, she had night blindness and always carried a candlestick after dark, so the others nicknamed her \"Little Candle.\"\nYuzuha was part of an experimental project called \"Project New Leaf.\" Since she never had a proper name, one of the lower-level researchers assigned to care for the children gave her the name \"Yuzuha.\" However, this name was never known to Ferox or the other higher-ups — they only ever referred to her as ES-07. Despite the name coming from the lab, Yuzuha has always felt the name carried a spark of life — and that spark was part of her luck.\nBoth of Yuzuha's younger sisters were adopted as infants, and when Baorong named them, he continued his tradition of using names inspired by plants.",

I even gave up on signing another two-week contract that was on the table.\n\nLater, before leaving the Waifei Peninsula, I took a trip to Sailume Bay.

I got lucky and bailed, but that poor bro had it rough - he still has to work in the Hollow.\n\nReally want to know what we actually saw - was it an Ethereal or some other monster?

  "QuestDesc_600010603": "We may have settled on a \"relax and wait it out\" approach, but just in case, let's split up with Yuzuha and Alice to check in with folks around the resort and find out what's been going on.",
  "QuestDesc_600010605": "Hmm... Three Gates, Midsummer Resort, and mosquitoes hovering in mid-air? So many threads to untangle. Better meet up with Alice and the others to put our heads together.",

  "QuestDesc_600010609": "Near the Lighthouse, Alice threw some punches near the ghost balloon, and what do you know — out popped a projector? What's that all about? Let's ask Alice.",
  "QuestDesc_600010610": "Looks like there's always tech hiding behind the supernatural... Come to think of it, Alice installed some new program on her phone too... I should ask her what she's planning.",
  "QuestDesc_600010611": "Another ghost balloon gone, and another projector appeared... Looks like we've cracked this paranormal case. Let's team up with our Spook Shack buddies and dismantle all these projectors.",
  "QuestDesc_600010612": "The projectors are all dismantled now. Let's meet up with the others near the music festival stage and figure out our next move.",

  "QuestDesc_600010708": "How dare they treat Empy like that... Well, they've brought this on themselves. Time to expose Three Gates's dirty deeds to the media!",
  "QuestDesc_600010709": "They even brought machines to cause trouble. For the sake of the summer music festival, we must stop them from wreaking any more havoc.",
  "QuestDesc_600010710": "Three Gates are defeated, and their manager's totally deflated... that's satisfying to see!",
  "QuestDesc_600010711": "The Three Gates folks got hauled off by Public Security, but the festival grounds are a total mess... Can tonight's music festival still open as planned?",
  "QuestDesc_600010712": "After all the ups and downs, the music festival is finally about to begin. I wonder how Alice and Yuzuha are feeling about it.",

  "QuestDesc_600010717": "Everyone's really vibing at the music festival...",
  "QuestDesc_600010718": "Though the music festival has ended, summer vibes still linger in the resort... I've run into quite a few other friends who came here for a vacation. Perhaps I should chat to them a little more before heading back with {M#Belle}{F#Wise}.",

  "QuestDesc_600015108": "Grandpa Ahab says someone spotted a mermaid at the deep-sea fishing spot. It sounds questionable, but you decide to check with Empy to verify it. If it's true, maybe Empy can take you out there to investigate.",

It turns out that Ahab once gave up everything in his pursuit of mermaids, and he too has always believed in the existence of these mythical creatures.
